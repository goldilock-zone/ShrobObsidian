- The legend of the institute for advanced study
- Apparently the institute was aimed at bringing forth the usefulness of useless knowledge
- A Free Society of Scholars
- The mathematician neither resorts to any observations in arriving at his or her mathematical insights nor do these mathematical insights, in and of themselves, entail observations, so that nothing we experience can undermine the grounds we have for knowing them.
	- The above statement, sort of reminds me of a feedback loop of confirmatory insights into radical theory, or a radical change from the mundane
- Mathematics is *a priori*
- Jewish Physics was infatuated with abstract mathematics
- Von Neumann followed Einstein to the IAS
- "The World is Intelligible"
- If reasoning and common sense should diverge, then... so much the worse for common sense!
- First Theorem: In any formal system adequate for number theory there exists an undecidable formula—that is, a formula that is not provable and whose negation is not provable. (This statement is occasionally referred to as Godel's first theorem.)
- Second Theorem: A corollary to the theorem is that the consistency of a formal system adequate for number theory cannot be proved within the system. (Sometimes it is this corollary that is referred to as Godel's theorem; it is also referred to as Godel's second theorem.)
- The entire notion of truth is embedded in our minds
- Godel's theorems don't demonstrate the limits of the human mind, but rather the limits of computational models of the human
- [[What is Metamathematics]]
- Questions to Epistemologists about mathematics: most specifically the question of how it is possible for it to be doing what it is doing.
- This is surprising: Spinoza and Leibniz, in particular, believed it was possible to appropriate the standards and methods of the mathematicians and generalize them so that they could answer all our posed questions: scientific, ethical, even theological.
- Do the theorems cast us out of the most exclusive cognitive club in epistemology, undermining our claim of being able to attain, in the area of mathematics at least, perfect certitude? Or do the theorems leave us members in good standing?
- "Science without epistemology is—insofar as it is thinkable at all—primitive and muddled."
- Godel had his own set of axioms
- Godel was strange, even for IAS
- Godel was also insufferable
- Godel and Einstein were best friends
- Somehow, their conventional chronology was entagled
- Shared isolation of the two souls
- What is the myth of Objectivity in Science?
- The Mind Body Problem
- Man keeps getting displaced form the center, over and over again in the history of science
- That the universe exists only as a series of approximations. Only within the limits determined by our relationship with it. Only through the understanding lodged inside the human head
- Godel's own world view about his theorem being world changing is contrary to what people make of his theory
- He thought his conclusions were "a" [[subsistent reality]].
- Einsteins and Godels Theorems were not a signpost for their signposts to take a subjectivist turn
- The heart of Einstein's scientific alienation is his rejection of the subjectivist turn.
- Einstein's theory was of objective spacetime, he wasn't making analogues
- Is adding emotions to research again recentering the human?
- [[Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics]]
- Positivism is dangerous apparently
- Einstein is almost Platonist in his expulsion of the rest of the scientific establishment from his later years. This is mathematical realism
- Mathematical realism says: It is what it is, because it is so.
- Godel's metamathematical view, his affirmation of the objective, independent existence of mathematical reality, constituted perhaps the essence of his life, which is to say what is undoubtedly true: that he was a strange man indeed.
- Godel identified himself with Uber Rationalist: Leibniz
- His Theorems lead to the formation of Recursion Theory and Model Theory.
- He destroyed Hilbert's central program
- Yet the metamathematical import of the theorems, which to Godel was their most important aspect, was disregarded.
- Godel was able to twist the intelligence mortifying material of paradox into a proof that leads us to deep insights into the nature of truth, and knowledge, and certainty.
- Heisenberg and Bohr themselves took subjectivist turns

# A Platonist among positivists
- A Weaver father, and nerdy mother
- We are born into a sort of ontological wonder (thaulamazein) that passes into oblivion as we get used to the lay of the land
- Anxious kid apparently
- He was frustrated with the severe limitation of their parents' understanding
- Godel's interest in physics had begun at the age of 15, when he read [[Goethe's theory of colors]]
- I think it is fair to say, however, that like so many of us Godel fell in love (with Platonism) while an undergraduate. He underwent love's ecstatic transfiguration, its radical reordering of priorities, giving life a new focus and meaning. One is not quite the same person as before.
- Godel used a sort of shorthand script, [[Gabelsberger]]
- Godel apparently answered a Questionnaire by Burke. He sent two sets of replies, one good and one bad
- The importance of mathematical inclination
- The ancient Greek philosopher's disdain for the [[Sophists]], particularly for such men as Protagoras, gave the negative connotation to the word for these itinerant teachers. Philosophy comes from the common root word
- Plato argued for absolute objectivism
- (Fickle, imperfect creatures who cannot even be counted on to love us in return and whose beauty not only cannot compete with the transcendent sort but also is subject to the corrosive actions of time)
- I like how Rebecca Goldstein sometimes imposes herself into her story
- Plato: become drunk on the beauty of truth—the sort of necessary and immutable truth acquired through pure reason
- Godel thought that number theory would allow him the best path to conceptual realism
- Einstein: Gedanken-experiments, thought-experiments, imagining himself hitching a ride on a light beam
- The moments of intuitions or thought-experiments or God knows-what that brought him to the proof itself
- [[The Origin of the idea of Incompleteness]]
- Vienna was Godel's intellectual center
- This physical concentration of academic life was indicative of the intellectual life in general
- The overall topic was the moral and intellectual death and decay of all that had come before, and the need to construct entirely new methodologies, forms, and foundations. It was this sustained theme in so many diverse fields that provoked the emergence of what we have come to call modernity, and even postmodernity: in literature, music, architecture, art, philosophy, psychology, and even, to some extent, science
- The political and social scene of Vienna was weird. The political crisis after the First World War almost caused the intellectual Revival
- Freud was in Vienna, but so was [[Zionism]], and Nazism
- What is the role of the intellectually active donor?
- "The psychoanalyst picks our dreams as if they were our pockets."
- An Intellectual Rut: Discredited ideas, solecisms, half-truths, and elaborately phrased nonpropositions carry the fatal taint of moral failure; there is a moral imperative to break with the past and think clearly.
- Vienna was a knowledge commons
- Weltanschauung, "a world-view, but one whose essence it was to avoid viewing the world."
- Kreise, or circles, more or less formal discussion groups in Vienna. The intellectual geometry of Vienna was densely inscribed with circles
- Why was Godel a Platonist, even though he was in a talk circle full of logical positivists
- He needed proof of viewpoints. [[Epistemics of Speculative Theory]]
- Logical positivism was first and foremost a movement that spoke in the name of the precision and progress associated with the sciences. A very german science. It was a form of Radical Empiricism
- On the one hand, the sort of questions that could be answered through a priori reasoning; these, according to Hume, had no ontologial import. These somehow do not tell us anything about the nature of the world, merely isomorphisms
- "the verificationist criterion for meaningfulness,"
- Positivists shunned pseudo propositions
- Positivism was seen as cognitive hygiene
- Neurath, in particular, tried to push the Circle in political directions, often making it seem, perhaps unintentionally, that there was more political homogeneity within the Circle than there in fact was.
- [[Hahn-Banach extension theorem]] in functional analysis.
- Hans Hahn was interested in parapsychological phenomena
- Feigl writes, provided "our philosophical movement with its international trade name."
- Why did I like logical positivism. I know I like it deep down, but elsewhere, in my exterior mind, I like to shun over reliance of rigor in theory
- Mathematical propositions, if not quite tautologies, are analogous to them.
- well-formed formulas, standardly abbreviated "wff," and pronounced "woof"
- For those who believe that mathematics is syntactic, the phrase "is true" takes on a special meaning when it is applied to a mathematical proposition: A mathematical proposition is true relative to the stipulated rules, the syntax, of a formal system. Analogously, for a moral relativist, like Protagoras, "is true," when applied to an ethical statement, is shorthand for "is true relative to x" where x is a person or, more likely, a conglomerate of ethically agreeing persons.
- [[Moral Truths Are Du Jour Social Constructs]]
- Godel's and Wittgenstein's views on the foundations of mathematics were, as we will see, at loggerheads, and neither could acknowledge the work of the other without renouncing what was most central in his own view.
- Ravel wrote: [[Concerto for the Left Hand]] for Wittgenstein's Brother
- Revisting [[Russel's Paradox]]
- Gottlob Frege
- Russell and Whitehead called their rules the "Theory of Types,", to prevent set theoretic paradoxes.
