- The legend of the institute for advanced study
- Apparently the institute was aimed at bringing forth the usefulness of useless knowledge
- A Free Society of Scholars
- The mathematician neither resorts to any observations in arriving at his or her mathematical insights nor do these mathematical insights, in and of themselves, entail observations, so that nothing we experience can undermine the grounds we have for knowing them.
	- The above statement, sort of reminds me of a feedback loop of confirmatory insights into radical theory, or a radical change from the mundane
- Mathematics is *a priori*
- Jewish Physics was infatuated with abstract mathematics
- Von Neumann followed Einstein to the IAS
- "The World is Intelligible"
- If reasoning and common sense should diverge, then... so much the worse for common sense!
- First Theorem: In any formal system adequate for number theory there exists an undecidable formula—that is, a formula that is not provable and whose negation is not provable. (This statement is occasionally referred to as Godel's first theorem.)
- Second Theorem: A corollary to the theorem is that the consistency of a formal system adequate for number theory cannot be proved within the system. (Sometimes it is this corollary that is referred to as Godel's theorem; it is also referred to as Godel's second theorem.)
- The entire notion of truth is embedded in our minds
- Godel's theorems don't demonstrate the limits of the human mind, but rather the limits of computational models of the human
- [[What is Metamathematics]]
- Questions to Epistemologists about mathematics: most specifically the question of how it is possible for it to be doing what it is doing.
- This is surprising: Spinoza and Leibniz, in particular, believed it was possible to appropriate the standards and methods of the mathematicians and generalize them so that they could answer all our posed questions: scientific, ethical, even theological.
- Do the theorems cast us out of the most exclusive cognitive club in epistemology, undermining our claim of being able to attain, in the area of mathematics at least, perfect certitude? Or do the theorems leave us members in good standing?
- "Science without epistemology is—insofar as it is thinkable at all—primitive and muddled."
- Godel had his own set of axioms
- Godel was strange, even for IAS
- Godel was also insufferable
- Godel and Einstein were best friends
- Somehow, their conventional chronology was entagled
- Shared isolation of the two souls
- What is the myth of Objectivity in Science?
- The Mind Body Problem
- Man keeps getting displaced form the center, over and over again in the history of science
- That the universe exists only as a series of approximations. Only within the limits determined by our relationship with it. Only through the understanding lodged inside the human head
- Godel's own world view about his theorem being world changing is contrary to what people make of his theory
- He thought his conclusions were "a" [[subsistent reality]].
- Einsteins and Godels Theorems were not a signpost for their signposts to take a subjectivist turn
- The heart of Einstein's scientific alienation is his rejection of the subjectivist turn.
- Einstein's theory was of objective spacetime, he wasn't making analogues
- Is adding emotions to research again recentering the human?
- [[Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics]]
- Positivism is dangerous apparently
- Einstein is almost Platonist in his expulsion of the rest of the scientific establishment from his later years. This is mathematical realism
- Mathematical realism says: It is what it is, because it is so.
- Godel's metamathematical view, his affirmation of the objective, independent existence of mathematical reality, constituted perhaps the essence of his life, which is to say what is undoubtedly true: that he was a strange man indeed.
- Godel identified himself with Uber Rationalist: Leibniz
- His Theorems lead to the formation of Recursion Theory and Model Theory.
- He destroyed Hilbert's central program
- Yet the metamathematical import of the theorems, which to Godel was their most important aspect, was disregarded.
- Godel was able to twist the intelligence mortifying material of paradox into a proof that leads us to deep insights into the nature of truth, and knowledge, and certainty.
- Heisenberg and Bohr themselves took subjectivist turns

# A Platonist among positivists
- A Weaver father, and nerdy mother
- We are born into a sort of ontological wonder (thaulamazein) that passes into oblivion as we get used to the lay of the land
- Anxious kid apparently
- He was frustrated with the severe limitation of their parents' understanding
- Godel's interest in physics had begun at the age of 15, when he read [[Goethe's theory of colors]]
- I think it is fair to say, however, that like so many of us Godel fell in love (with Platonism) while an undergraduate. He underwent love's ecstatic transfiguration, its radical reordering of priorities, giving life a new focus and meaning. One is not quite the same person as before.
- Godel used a sort of shorthand script, [[Gabelsberger]]
- Godel apparently answered a Questionnaire by Burke. He sent two sets of replies, one good and one bad
