- The epistemology of mathematics is different from the philosophy of math's practice
- There is a difference between sacrosanct mathematics practice, where there are some norms that are accepted, and some that fall within the realm of the acceptable.
- Ayer, Hempel, Boolos, Benacerraf, and Putnam are on the side of preservationists, and Russel and Carnap question the very foundations of mathematics
- Maybe philosophical texts should have different points of view

- On the argument about infinity: The shifting of the burden of proof seems to be asking for infinity to be expressible only in the critic's terms
- Russell: Mathematics is not concerned with physical existence, but rather with the possible existence of objects.
- Axiom of Infinity in mathematics:
	- The Axiom of Infinity is one of the axioms in set theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with sets and their properties. It was introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo in 1908 as part of his set theory axioms, and it is one of the foundational principles of set theory.
	
	The Axiom of Infinity essentially asserts the existence of an infinite set. More formally, it can be stated as follows:
	
	"There exists at least one set, denoted as 'ω' (the lowercase Greek letter omega), such that:
	1. The empty set (∅) is in 'ω' (ω contains the empty set).
	2. If 'x' is an element of 'ω,' then the successor of 'x' (denoted as 'x ∪ {x}') is also in 'ω' (ω is closed under the operation of forming the successor of its elements)."
	
	In simpler terms, this axiom guarantees the existence of a set that contains the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) as its elements. The natural numbers can be constructed within this set by starting with the empty set (∅), then forming the successor of ∅, which is {∅}, and so on. Each step gives you a new natural number.
	
	The Axiom of Infinity is crucial in establishing the foundation for infinite sets and enabling mathematicians to develop the theory of infinite sets, including concepts like countability, cardinality, and transfinite numbers (such as aleph numbers). It plays a fundamental role in modern set theory and forms the basis for many other mathematical structures and theories involving infinite sets.
- Axiom of infinity in the philosophy of mathematics
	In the philosophy of mathematics, the Axiom of Infinity is a foundational concept that has been the subject of philosophical discussions and debates. Philosophers of mathematics have explored its implications and significance in various ways. Here are some key philosophical perspectives on the Axiom of Infinity:
	
	1. **Ontological Debate:** Philosophers of mathematics have debated the ontological status of mathematical objects, particularly infinite sets. The Axiom of Infinity asserts the existence of an infinite set, which raises questions about the nature of infinity and whether infinite mathematical entities exist in reality or are merely abstract concepts.
	
	2. **Epistemological Considerations:** Some philosophers have examined the epistemological aspects of the Axiom of Infinity. They question how mathematicians come to know or justify the truth of such an axiom, given that it posits the existence of objects that cannot be observed empirically. This touches on broader discussions about the nature of mathematical knowledge and its relationship to empirical experience.
	
	3. **Intuitionism:** Intuitionism is a philosophical approach to mathematics that challenges the classical view of mathematical truth and relies heavily on intuition and constructive reasoning. Intuitionist mathematicians and philosophers, such as L.E.J. Brouwer, have questioned the Axiom of Infinity and its use in mathematics, advocating for a more finitistic and constructivist approach to mathematical objects.
	
	4. **Platonism:** Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics posits that mathematical entities exist independently of human thought and are discovered rather than invented. From a Platonist perspective, the Axiom of Infinity is seen as affirming the existence of an infinite mathematical reality, and it aligns with the belief in the objective existence of mathematical objects.
	
	5. **Structuralism:** Structuralism is another philosophical viewpoint that focuses on the relationships and structures within mathematics rather than the existence of specific mathematical objects. Structuralists may interpret the Axiom of Infinity as asserting the existence of certain structural properties within mathematical systems.
	
	6. **Philosophy of Set Theory:** Much of the philosophical discussion surrounding the Axiom of Infinity is rooted in the philosophy of set theory. Philosophers have explored questions related to set theory's axiomatic foundations, the nature of sets, and the role of infinite sets in mathematics.
	
	In summary, the Axiom of Infinity is a foundational concept in the philosophy of mathematics that has prompted discussions about the nature of mathematical objects, the epistemological status of mathematical truths, and different philosophical approaches to mathematics, including Platonism, intuitionism, structuralism, and more. It continues to be a subject of philosophical inquiry and debate within the philosophy of mathematics.

- A [[Pairle]] in the direction of the philosophy of mathematics: Russell and others thinking that the axiom of infinity is self evident, while other mathematicians like Hilbert wish for this to be proved
- Hilbert: there are statements whose truth and falsity can be expressed by combinatorial arguments
- Intuitionists: Define a propositional calculus for dealing with concepts that do not necessarily correspond to a well defined totality
- For some reason, the intuitionists think that the totality of infinity is not well defined
- Intuitionists hold three truth values: True and False in a system, and neither true nor false: true in some models, and false in others
- The notion of well defined model, means that a system (of logic, loosely) is closed
- Part of mathematics that is safe, is whose consistency is self evident on the basis of an interpretation

- Logicists tried to prove that mathematics purely deals with "Pure relations among subjects", but Hilbert's position was that mathematics also deals with expressions, and self evident truths, that appeal to the human intuition. Logicisms were able to unify mathematics under one formal system
- Property Theory = Set theory
- Kant: Arithmetic was synthetic a priori
- Analytic, to Kant, meant that they were consistent under the law of non contradiction.
