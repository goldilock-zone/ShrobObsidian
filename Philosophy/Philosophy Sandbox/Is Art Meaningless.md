## The Artists Intentions
- Is art ever about anything?
- You can be WRONG about art, therefore the art isn't purely subjective
- I have no idea what art means sometimes
- Audiences to feel trapped in his paintings: Rothco
- Meaning is part of the art
- Fountain: What makes it different is its meaning.
- Pale Fire: Vladimir Novikov - Charles' interpretation of the protagonists poem is a cacophony. Did he murder John?
- "In Defence of the Author": Ask the author for the meaning, or at least attempt to infer the meaning
- "What is an Author?": Foucault says that even the author is "interpreting:" from somewhere.
- "Death of the author": Roland Barthe, talking about how we need to engage with the text instead of constantly looking for interpretation, or attempting to regurgitate the interpretation
- "Patterns of Intentions": We might have a very clear goal for other things, but not the art. Each brushstroke causes the intention to develop. There is an infinite sequence of intentions.
- We cant reconstruct intentions after building the intentions?

## Feeling the Right Emotions
- Does cubism make us feel things?
- "Against Interpretation": Susan Sontag, just experience the art. To interpret is to impoverish.
- Art isn't philosophy with pictures
- Tune in to the aesthetic experience
- Sometimes art is just hard to get it, and that's what it's meant to be
- Race: The play. It's set in the defense lawyers offices, to protect a white guy who raped the black women.
- David Mammut: Theatre
- Just, how do you feel?
- Art galleries make me anxious, me too.
- Feelings caused by art?
- Connective feelings: Connected contexts
- "The Fear of Aesthetics"
- "What is Art?": Tolstoy

## The Art Market
- Money.
- Asset.
- "The Hanseatic Art World"
- "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction": Walter Benjamin
- Zombie Formalism
- Being eloquent about nothing?
- Trends in Art: Social and Political Meaning
- "Doing without Art"?
- "Missing Out"

## Self Portrait
- Well art is, myself
- We can't read art, if we try to get out of ourselves, and our personal experince
- Are we missing out?
- Interpretation: Maximize artistic value
- It's not a competition
- Some interpretations are less beautiful than others
- Internal struggle of artists, with other people interpreting art
