Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason, often referred to as the "PSR" for short, is a fundamental concept in philosophy. It can be stated in various ways, but a common formulation is as follows:

"Every event or phenomenon has a sufficient reason or explanation that can account for why it is the way it is, and not otherwise."

In other words, according to Leibniz, there is a reason or cause for everything that happens or exists in the world. This principle reflects his belief in the rationality of the universe and his rejection of arbitrary or unexplained events. Leibniz argued that the PSR is a fundamental principle of metaphysics and a key to understanding the nature of reality.

Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason has been influential in the history of philosophy and has been interpreted and discussed by many philosophers over the centuries. It is often used in discussions of causation, determinism, and the nature of explanation in various branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of science.
