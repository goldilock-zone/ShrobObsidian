-  Do formats become set up contingently? :
  ChatGPT: French philosopher Michel Serres was known for his interdisciplinary approach to knowledge and his emphasis on communication, relationships, and complex systems. To argue as Serres might, I would approach the topic by considering the interconnectedness and contingency of various elements. Here's how Serres might argue on the topic of formats becoming set up contingently:

Serres might begin by highlighting the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. In his philosophy, he often spoke of the "noise" or interference that exists in the spaces between entities. This noise represents the constant exchange of information and influence between different elements in a system. In the context of formats, Serres might argue that the establishment of formats is not isolated but occurs within a web of interrelated factors.

Next, Serres might emphasize the role of communication in shaping formats. He believed that communication is the foundation of human knowledge and that it occurs through various means, including language, symbols, and gestures. Formats, whether they are textual, visual, or auditory, are mediums of communication. They emerge and evolve through the interactions between individuals and groups, reflecting the contingent nature of human communication.

Serres might also consider the concept of "parasitism" in his argument. In his work, he often discussed how entities in a system can be both hosts and parasites, mutually affecting each other. Formats, he might argue, can be seen as parasitic entities that adapt to and shape the environments in which they exist. They borrow from existing conventions, adapt to changing circumstances, and influence the way information is conveyed.

Furthermore, Serres might bring attention to the role of technology in shaping formats. He believed that technology is not just a tool but an integral part of human existence. Formats, he might argue, are deeply influenced by technological advancements, which can introduce new possibilities and contingencies. For instance, the invention of the printing press radically transformed the format of books and information dissemination.

In conclusion, arguing as Michel Serres would involve emphasizing the interconnectedness, communication, parasitism, and technological influence that shape the contingency of formats. He would view formats as dynamic entities that adapt and evolve within complex systems of human interaction and knowledge exchange. Serres' philosophical perspective encourages us to consider the intricate web of factors that contribute to the establishment and transformation of formats in various contexts.

- Contingency is a philosophical concept that deals with the idea that events, objects, or states of affairs are not necessary or predetermined but instead depend on various factors, conditions, or circumstances. (Oh, that's what contingency means, when I think of recursivity and contingency). Philosophers have explored the notion of contingency in various ways throughout the history of philosophy, and it has important implications for discussions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and the philosophy of history. Here are some key aspects of contingency in philosophy:

	1. Contingency vs. Necessity: Contingency is often contrasted with necessity. Necessity implies that something must be the case, and its occurrence is predetermined or dictated by some inherent nature or external force. Contingency, on the other hand, suggests that events or states of affairs could have been otherwise, and their occurrence is not determined by any inherent necessity.
	
	2. Metaphysical Contingency: In metaphysics, philosophers explore the question of whether the universe itself is contingent or necessary. Some philosophical systems propose that the universe is contingent, meaning it could have been different or might not have existed at all. Others argue for the necessity of the universe, suggesting that it exists necessarily and could not have been otherwise.
	
	3. Contingency in Epistemology: Contingency also plays a role in epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge. Philosophers debate whether knowledge claims are contingent (subject to change based on new evidence) or have a certain degree of necessity (not subject to change). This relates to discussions about the nature of truth and certainty.
	
	4. Ethics and Contingency: Ethical theories often grapple with questions of moral contingency. For example, some ethical theories posit that moral principles are contingent on cultural, societal, or individual factors, leading to moral relativism. Others argue for moral principles that have a degree of necessity or universality.
	
	5. Historical Contingency: In the philosophy of history, scholars examine the idea that historical events and developments are contingent on various factors, including individual actions, societal changes, and chance occurrences. This perspective challenges deterministic views of history.
	
	6. Existentialism: Existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus explore human existence in an indifferent and contingent universe. They emphasize the individual's freedom and responsibility in navigating a world devoid of inherent meaning or purpose.
	
	7. The Problem of Evil: The existence of evil in the world is often discussed in terms of contingency. Theodicy, which addresses the problem of evil, explores whether the existence of evil is contingent or necessary and how it relates to the concept of a benevolent and omnipotent deity.
	
	In summary, contingency is a philosophical concept that raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, ethics, history, and human existence. Philosophers approach contingency from various angles, and it continues to be a central topic of discussion and debate in many branches of philosophy.
- Recursivity, in the context of philosophy, is a concept that refers to the idea of self-reference or self-replication within a system or a theory. It involves the idea that a statement, argument, or concept refers back to itself in some way, creating a loop or feedback mechanism. Recursivity has been explored in various branches of philosophy, including philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, epistemology, and metaphysics. Here are some ways in which recursivity is relevant to philosophy:
	
	1. Philosophy of Language: Recursivity plays a crucial role in the philosophy of language, particularly in discussions of language's capacity for self-reference. One classic example is the liar paradox, represented by the sentence "This statement is false." If the statement is true, then it must be false, but if it is false, then it must be true, creating a self-referential loop that challenges traditional notions of truth and meaning.
	
	2. Epistemology: In epistemology, questions about self-reference and recursion arise when considering beliefs about beliefs. For example, if you believe that "I believe X," you are making a second-order belief about your first-order belief. This recursion can lead to questions about the stability and justification of beliefs.
	
	3. Philosophy of Mathematics: Recursivity is a fundamental concept in the philosophy of mathematics, particularly in discussions of mathematical induction and the concept of a recursive function. Recursive functions are defined in terms of themselves, and they play a central role in mathematical reasoning and the foundations of mathematics.
	
	4. Logic: Recursion can be found in various areas of logic, including the study of self-referential statements and paradoxes like the Russell paradox in set theory. These paradoxes often arise when attempting to define sets or predicates that refer to themselves.
	
	5. Metaphysics: Recursivity can be relevant in discussions of the nature of reality and the self. Philosophers may explore questions about the self referring to itself, the nature of consciousness, and the implications of self-reference for personal identity.
	
	6. Systems Theory: In the philosophy of science and systems theory, recursivity is a key concept when considering feedback loops and complex, self-replicating systems. It is often used to model phenomena in biology, sociology, and cybernetics.
	
	7. Postmodern Philosophy: Some postmodern philosophers, such as Jacques Derrida, have explored the idea of recursivity in deconstructionist theories. Derrida's notion of "iterability" emphasizes the repetition and recontextualization of language and meaning.
	
	Recursivity is a concept that challenges traditional notions of linearity, causality, and stability. It highlights the intricate ways in which systems, concepts, and statements can refer to themselves or create self-referential loops, leading to philosophical questions about meaning, truth, knowledge, and the nature of reality. Philosophers continue to explore the implications and limitations of recursivity in various areas of philosophical inquiry.
- Derrida's Concept of Iterability:
	Jacques Derrida's concept of "iterability" is a central idea in his philosophy and is closely associated with his deconstructionist approach to language and meaning. Iterability refers to the capacity of linguistic signs (words, phrases, texts) to be repeated and reused in different contexts and by different speakers. Derrida's exploration of iterability challenges traditional ideas of language, meaning, and representation. Here's a more detailed explanation of Derrida's concept of iterability:
	
	1. Recontextualization: Derrida argues that language is not a fixed and stable system of signs with determinate meanings. Instead, he suggests that the meaning of a word or a text is contingent and can only be understood in relation to its context of use. When a word or text is repeated or cited in a new context, it takes on new meanings or connotations, which may differ from its original context.
	
	2. Endless Chain of Citations: Derrida famously stated, "There is nothing outside the text." He means that language is a self-referential system in which words and texts refer to other words and texts in an endless chain of citations. Every word or text is situated within this network of references, and its meaning is shaped by its position in relation to other linguistic elements.
	
	3. Lack of Origin: Derrida argues that there is no ultimate or stable "origin" of meaning in language. Traditional philosophy often sought to ground meaning in some foundational or original signifier, but Derrida challenges this idea. Instead, he suggests that meaning is always deferred and dependent on the play of differences within language.
	
	4. Deconstruction: Iterability is a key element of Derrida's deconstructive method, which seeks to reveal the inherent contradictions, ambiguities, and undecidabilities within texts and concepts. Deconstruction involves closely examining how language operates, how meanings are deferred, and how concepts are destabilized by their reliance on language.
	
	5. Contextual Instability: Because of iterability, Derrida argues that language and texts are never fully stable or self-contained. They are always open to reinterpretation and can be reinscribed with new meanings as they are used and reused in different contexts.
	
	6. Political and Ethical Implications: Derrida's ideas about iterability have implications beyond linguistics and philosophy. They can be applied to discussions of power, identity, and ethics. Derrida's work often addresses how language can be used to reinforce hierarchies and how deconstruction can expose the contingent and potentially oppressive nature of linguistic and social structures.
	
	In summary, Derrida's concept of iterability challenges conventional notions of language as a stable and transparent medium of communication. Instead, he emphasizes the instability, context-dependence, and self-referential nature of language, suggesting that meaning is always deferred and subject to reinterpretation. This idea plays a central role in his deconstructionist philosophy and has had a significant influence on literary theory, linguistics, and cultural studies.
- Proof, Reason and Format leave a residue
- Prime Number theorem: 
	  The "law of distribution for prime numbers" typically refers to the Prime Number Theorem, which is a fundamental result in number theory. The Prime Number Theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers among the positive integers. It provides an estimate of how prime numbers are distributed as you move further along the number line.
	
	The Prime Number Theorem, formulated independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin in 1896, states that:
	
	π(x) ~ (x / ln(x))
	
	Here's what this notation means:
	
	- π(x) represents the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the positive integer x.
	- "~" denotes asymptotic equivalence, which means that as x becomes very large, the ratio of π(x) to (x / ln(x)) approaches 1.
	- "ln(x)" represents the natural logarithm of x.
	
	In simpler terms, the Prime Number Theorem tells us that as you consider larger and larger positive integers x, the proportion of primes among those numbers approaches 1 divided by the natural logarithm of x.
	
	This theorem is a crucial result in number theory because it provides insights into the behavior of prime numbers and their distribution. It also has applications in various areas of mathematics and science, including cryptography and the analysis of algorithms.
	
	The Prime Number Theorem does not tell us exactly where individual prime numbers are located, but it gives us a powerful tool for understanding their distribution on a large scale. It's an essential result in the study of prime numbers and their properties.

- Epigenesis: Epigenesis is a biological concept that refers to the development and growth of an organism from a fertilized egg (zygote) through a series of progressive and increasingly complex stages. It contrasts with the previously popular theory of preformation, which posited that all the future parts of an organism were preformed within the egg or sperm.

	Key points about epigenesis include:
	
	1. Progressive Development: Epigenesis asserts that organisms develop progressively, with new structures and functions emerging during the course of their growth. In other words, the organism's form and complexity arise over time as a result of a series of developmental processes.
	
	2. Cellular Differentiation: Epigenesis involves the differentiation of cells into various specialized cell types. Cells in a developing organism undergo specific changes that determine their future roles in tissues and organs.
	
	3. Interaction with the Environment: Epigenesis recognizes the role of environmental factors in development. Environmental influences, such as nutrients, chemicals, and signals from neighboring cells, play a crucial role in shaping an organism's development.
	
	4. Historical Significance: The concept of epigenesis was historically significant in the development of embryology and biology. It challenged the earlier theory of preformation, which proposed that all the parts of an organism existed in miniature form within the egg or sperm. Epigenesis laid the foundation for a more modern understanding of embryonic development.
	
	5. Modern Insights: In modern biology, epigenesis is often associated with the field of epigenetics. Epigenetics explores how heritable changes in gene expression occur without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms involve modifications to DNA or associated proteins that can influence gene activity and cellular differentiation during development.
	
	6. Epigenetic Marks: Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can have lasting effects on gene expression patterns. These marks can be influenced by environmental factors and may play a role in various biological processes, including development, aging, and disease.
	
	7. Contemporary Research: Epigenesis and epigenetics are active areas of research in biology. Scientists study how epigenetic modifications influence the development of organisms, the impact of environmental factors on epigenetic marks, and their role in diseases such as cancer.
	
	In summary, epigenesis is a fundamental concept in biology that describes the process of development in organisms from a single fertilized egg to a complex multicellular organism. It emphasizes the role of progressive changes, cellular differentiation, and environmental interactions in shaping an organism's form and function. Modern research in epigenetics continues to shed light on the mechanisms underlying these processes and their broader implications in biology and health.

- The term "mimetic impetus" is not a widely recognized scientific or philosophical term. However, we can break down the meanings of the two words to infer a possible interpretation.
	
	"Mimetic" comes from "mimesis," which is a concept in literature and philosophy meaning imitation or mimicry. In biology, "mimetic" often refers to mimicry in animals and plants, such as when one species evolves to resemble another.
	
	"Impetus," on the other hand, means a force that causes something (like a process or activity) to be done or to become more active; a stimulus or a driving force.
	
	Putting these concepts together, "mimetic impetus" could possibly refer to a driving force or stimulus behind mimicry or imitation. Here are a few contexts where such an idea might be relevant:
	
	1. **Evolutionary Biology**: In the context of evolutionary biology, mimetic impetus could refer to the evolutionary pressure that drives species to develop mimetic features. For example, the presence of predators could be an impetus for a species to evolve camouflage that mimics its environment.
	
	2. **Sociology and Anthropology**: In social contexts, the mimetic impetus could describe the social or cultural pressures that lead individuals to imitate or conform to group behaviors.
	
	3. **Literature and Art**: In artistic creation, mimetic impetus could refer to the inspiration or motivation that leads artists to create works that imitate life or the works of other artists.
	
	4. **Philosophy**: Drawing from the philosophy of René Girard, one might use the term "mimetic impetus" to describe the drive or motivation behind mimetic desire, which is the desire for something that is based on another person's desire for the same thing.
	
	To give a more accurate interpretation, more context would be needed as to how "mimetic impetus" is being used. If this is a term from a specific field of study, text, or a concept you're developing, providing more details would help in giving a precise explanation.

# Popper's Theory on the exactness of science

Popper's criterion for the exactness of science is deeply rooted in his philosophy of science, particularly his views on falsifiability. According to Karl Popper, a prominent philosopher of science, the exactness or scientific validity of a theory is determined by its falsifiability, not by its verifiability. This means that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to conceive of an observation or an experiment that could prove it false. ^997198

Popper argued that the true power and exactness of scientific theories lie in their ability to be rigorously tested and potentially disproven, rather than their capacity to be confirmed or verified. This perspective marked a significant shift from the traditional positivist view, which held that the exactness of science was based on the accumulation of positive empirical evidence in support of theories.

In summary, Popper's criterion for the exactness of science is that a theory must be falsifiable – it must make predictions that can be tested and potentially shown to be false. This approach emphasizes the tentative and provisional nature of scientific knowledge, highlighting the importance of continuous testing and revision of theories in the pursuit of understanding the natural world.

- It's interesting that falsifiability is taken as fundamental to the proof of a scientific method. It is pointing to the aura [[Aura and Noosphere]] of the deep negative, when we deal with ideas in science.  ^28668a

## Metaphysics and Metanomics
- Greek Librarians inventing "Meta"
- Metaphysics means that everything cannot be exact.
- In this context, what does being exact even mean? [[Exactness]]
- Reason, is a means of "forcible boarding or inspection". This is not a critique of reason, but rather a format to view how formats shape the world around us

## Learning Inventing
- Three dimensions of knowledge: Cognitive, Collective, Stony
- Learning is almost like giving birth, the gestation period of the knowledge is like me internalizing something that I have learnt
- Externalization, or giving birth of knowledge is almost like exo darwinism
- This gestation happens through meditative labour

## Communion of Saints
- Solvay Conference, and the intellectual episode it was, and how the communion of saint properly used the collective aura of knowledge. I'm using the word aura a lot, I'm not exactly sure why?

# The Adoptive Son
- Administration is a format that was invented by Hellenic monotheism
- St. Paul: Coreligionist persecuted him, Philosophers mocked him, and 
- He was a combination of identities i.e. the formats around him

## Belongingness and Identity
- my identity does not reduce to my belongingness
- Confusing belonging as identity is a logical error
- Subset definition of belongingness (x ∈ A
- The Greeks' measures, norms and formats originated in belongingness
- So at the opening of the first century of our era, the idea and behaviour of belongingness was covering the Mediterranean. Greek culture taught one belongingness, political and cosmic at the same time; Israel’s tradition passed on a second one, holy; Rome’s did so for a third one, juridical.

## Hominization
- Is basically the act of looking at identity through the lens of subjectivity and not belongingness

## Three Contingencies of Universal Consciousness
- the [[Epistles]] give a new meaning to three terms: a verb, a noun and a subject.
- ‘We walk in Faith, not in clear reason’, where reason is defined by binary logic
- The very opposite of assurance; a fear that trembles between being and non-being; in short, a consciousness. The exit from every belongingness. This is how modern consciousness, single, double, multiple, trembling, thrown into time and eternity …, was born.
- omnitude integrates faith and hope and plunges, with even less assurance, into the [[contingency]], fluctuating and dangerous, proper to relations.
- The new self is constructed from a triple contingency: faith and doubt; hope that will be happy at an indeterminate time; bonds of unconditional Love. Three weaknesses, three strengths.

# The evaluation of the I
- The credo (effective), precedes the cogito(vague)
- Courage alone separates I am from I have value. ‘I don’t know who I am’ is most often understood as ‘I don’t matter to anyone.’ Quitting the isolation of pure identity, the I throws itself into the network of relations of belongingness.
- Somehow, this equation to existential questions as an indicator of worth leads to the metrification of treatments of the Other
- As soon as he became radically alone, he sacrificed to collective values, wealth and hierarchy
- Coming about like me, his Son resembles me in contingency, unexpectedness, poverty: born on straw, wandering like the homeless, condemned to the lowest of tortures, descending the scale of every collective value all the way down to zero. The incarnation makes the assessment from just now reality: the abstract zero accompanies the lake fishermen in flesh and blood and dies between two thieves. Ego equals zero.

## Paul, Son
- Let’s return to relations. Who dictates this error-free law, with hundreds of clauses, whose rule formats gestures and the minutes of the day? 
- Son is not always right, doesn’t know everything, seeks, stumbles, wanders, makes mistakes, retraces his steps, risks error, blunders, the whip, the rocks under stoning, storms and shipwreck, hunger and thirst, prison, solitude, being let down in a basket along a wall of confinement
- returning to blood ties recently caused us to regress towards archaic illnesses

# The power of death and resurrection
- Enslaved to the formats of reason, the master repeats. Regulated by the dialectic, like mechanical dolls, the master and the slave, in an apparent struggle, in reality obey the empire of death, each of them behaving like its slave. 

## Dead Object
- Far from fleeing death, we shaped it in Statues. Condemned men, repressed murderers, fascinated by death, we turn it into spectacle and story; it incessantly haunts our representations; maybe there is no representation except of it.

## [[Renascent]] Object
- Who am I? This bifurcation. The [[pairle]] of the [[escutcheon]], a figure crossing in chiasm. Exhausted, indefatigable. Spurned, passionately in love. Unconscious, keenly penetrating. Earth and air, crawling, flying. Water and fire, incandescent frost. Enthusiastic- indifferent. An athlete and an abortion, living, full of resources. Weight and grace. Headstrong, scatterbrained. Dormant-inert-carnal and awake-nascent-carnal. Lying, standing; pathetic, enterprising. Emotion and abstraction. Me and always other. Mixed-race, completed lefty, Educated-Third. Hermaphrodite. Angel and animal. Statue and music. On balance, crying with joy.

## The Project of Immortality
- En route. We only have one project, one future, one hope: the inventive victory over necessary and formatted death.
- Our species became, is becoming and will become such for having mastered, more than space and things, time.

- expected effects remain similar to what precedes, the sequence plunges into a format that’s predictable by the ordinary rule of causality: the hours follow one another, duration flows

## Nature and Cultures
- In manipulating the atom, the chain of genes or cloning bacteria …, aren’t we playing with fire? 
- The anxiety attached to the story of the sorcerer’s apprentice has affected [[Homo faber]] from its first productions and haunted our technologies and our sciences all the way up to this morning
- Before chaos theory, Poincaré demonstrated ([[Poincare's demonstration that the solar system is a chaotic system]]) that the Earth could, without warning, leave the solar system and depart, it too.

## Action and Thought
-  Newness along with the things around him, things subjected to a suddenly broken law
- Neither the tyrant nor the slave assesses their scope. Tomorrow, the former will fall, of himself, and the latter will scorn taking power in order to try to establish a less stupid world.
- The "Branching" Theory of history is interesting: When Saint Paul announced the Good News, he grafted the Christian branch onto the Jewish tree and its Pharisean bough

## Jubilation/Gambling
- Fortune, sometimes, smiles on daringness, alone reasonable; learned ignorance thinks.

## Four News Things
- The old stem, present, continues to vibrate; the new branch forms the observable universe
- Four new things – material bodies, universe, life, humanity … – can be summed up in a single word, nature. How should we define it? By its original meaning: that which was born, that which is born, that which will be born; that is, a narrative of newborn and contingent events that are unpredictable before they occur but formatted as a semi-necessary chain when drawn descending towards us.

## Boredom
- Each line falls into line with monotonous rules, always modelled on the same format of power and death
- The universe is running to the big crunch, a terminal crushing, symmetrical to the big bang; the Sun is running towards its nova, the final explosion; stem cells are running towards a series of inhibitions; species are running towards their extinction; invention towards repetition; new thought towards litany; works towards commentary; violence towards violence, power towards power, both towards death

## New Praise of Format
- Training allows us to progress following the cadenced return of gestures and exercises.
- There can be no life without the law-abiding return of the dawn nor can there be spring without the eternal return to the vernal point, no poetry without rhythm, no harmony without the anharmony of sevenths or style without the breaking of style, no solar system without the chaos that can make a planet bifurcate from its ellipse. Time runs towards entropy or, bifurcating, cadences the expansion of the universe and vital evolution.
- Divergence, emergence. An exception to nothingness:

## The Theory of Four Truths
- Sciences, philosophies, arts, religions, politics … invent newnesses the way genes mutate or particles bifurcate.

## Us, In this story
- Merely objectively follow a succession of states of affairs but can transform the one who announces it and those who will hear it. 
- At a point, a discontinuity breaks a continuous path. There, a catastrophe of cataracts, in a few days, interrupted centuries of ploughing
- I wake up from my dogma; imitating, I invent; a trunk, I become a branch; fastened into the donkey skin, I exit. I convert. Dead, I am reborn.

## The Ramification of Language
- [[Plosives]], [[fricatives]], [[labiodentals]] …, consonants constrict the emission of vocalises or vowels in their passing. Lips, tongue, teeth and palate form complicated barriers, closures or baffles …, whose arrangement incessantly breaks, intersects and reorients the vocal flow. 
- Do you seek to recount? Tell how language itself speaks. The form furnishes the content.

## Branch-Time
- Many linguists give the Latin tempus two opposing Greek roots, the verb τείνω teinō, to stretch out, continuously … and another one, τέμνω temno, to cut up or interrupt: again stem and branch.
- Time mixes the continuousness of tension with the discontinuousness of rupture, a flux that flows with a filter that prevents it from passing
- Pulverized by mutations and the deadly filter that is selection, evolution explodes into bouquets, droplets and jets of life

## Disquietude
- Time is measured by spring and disquietude.
- In the same literal sense, existence drags me out of rest or removes me from equilibrium. Thus existence launches me into time.
- I am disquieted, therefore I exist

# Advent
## How are we to be reborn? Through good encounter

- How can it be denied that there was a before and an after

## Autocatalysis
- This is why: long ago, during a winter, it snowed a little there, at altitude. Very little, barely above equilibrium. But the thin layer deposited in that way did not melt the following summer, cooler than usual. These long cold spells arrived; no one noticed them. The next winter, it again snowed little but enough to cover over the previous snowfall, already frozen. 
- Random chance and knock on effects

## The birth of the earth and of a group
- Yet, at the beginning, one grain no doubt encountered another grain, which, by themselves, attracted a bigger third one, which, already substantial, exerted a more considerable attraction. Thus a self-perpetuating cycle, whose steady-state regime and its limit, our planet, are known to us, formed this planet by accretion, so much so that it still burns inside with these impacts

## Announcements
- Given millennia of farces and dramas, guess which character is cited most often: the messenger

## The Principle of Reason
