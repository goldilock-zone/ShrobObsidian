# What We Owe to The Future
The concept of "What We Owe to the Future" is closely related to the work of William MacAskill, a prominent figure in the effective altruism movement. While William MacAskill is not the sole proponent of this idea, his work in effective altruism addresses the ethical obligations that individuals and societies have toward future generations, particularly in the context of doing the most good with available resources.

MacAskill's perspective on what we owe to the future can be summarized as follows:

1. Long-Term Impact: MacAskill emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term consequences of our actions and decisions. He argues that we should strive to make choices that have a positive and lasting impact on the well-being of future generations.

2. Effective Altruism: MacAskill's effective altruism framework encourages individuals to use evidence and reason to determine how to maximize the good they can do with their resources. This approach extends to making choices that benefit future generations, such as supporting interventions that address global challenges like poverty, health, and existential risks.

3. Existential Risks: MacAskill is concerned with the potential catastrophic risks that could threaten humanity's existence or severely harm future generations. He argues that we have a strong moral duty to reduce such risks to ensure the survival and well-being of our descendants.

4. Intergenerational Equity: MacAskill's ethical framework aligns with the principle of intergenerational equity, which asserts that future generations should have equitable access to resources, opportunities, and a livable environment. He advocates for policies and actions that promote fairness and justice across generations.

5. Moral Trade-offs: MacAskill acknowledges that there are often moral trade-offs to consider when making decisions that impact both the present and the future. Effectively addressing global challenges may require sacrifices in the short term to achieve greater benefits in the long term.

While William MacAskill is primarily known for his work in effective altruism and his focus on maximizing positive impact, his ideas intersect with the broader discussion about what we owe to the future. He encourages individuals to take seriously their moral obligations to future generations and to act in ways that promote the well-being and flourishing of humanity over time. This perspective aligns with broader ethical and philosophical discussions on intergenerational justice and sustainability.

# Key Concepts:
Effective altruism is a philosophical and practical approach to doing good that seeks to maximize the positive impact of one's actions and resources on the well-being of others. It is driven by evidence, reason, and a commitment to making the world a better place. Here are some key concepts of effective altruism:

1. Maximizing Impact: Effective altruism emphasizes the idea of maximizing positive impact. It encourages individuals to focus on actions and interventions that can achieve the greatest amount of good or alleviate the most suffering, rather than merely doing what feels good or is convenient.

2. Evidence-Based Decision-Making: Effective altruists place a strong emphasis on evidence and empirical data when making decisions about how to do the most good. They seek out information and research to determine the effectiveness of different interventions and strategies.

3. Rationality and Reasoning: Effective altruism encourages rational and logical thinking. It advocates for careful consideration of the expected consequences of one's actions and the use of cost-benefit analysis to determine which interventions are the most effective.

4. Cause Prioritization: Effective altruists prioritize the selection of causes that have the potential for high impact. They often focus on global issues such as global health, poverty alleviation, animal welfare, and the reduction of existential risks.

5. Effective Giving: Effective altruists emphasize the importance of making informed and strategic decisions about charitable giving. They often donate to organizations that have a proven track record of achieving results and rigorously evaluating their impact.

6. Career Choice: Effective altruism extends to career choices. It encourages individuals to consider pursuing careers in fields where they can have the most significant positive impact, whether through earning to give (donating a portion of one's income) or working directly in high-impact roles.

7. Long-Term Perspective: Effective altruism takes a long-term perspective, considering not only the immediate effects of actions but also their implications for future generations. It seeks to address existential risks and promote intergenerational equity.

8. Impact Evaluation: Effective altruists value impact evaluation and continuous learning. They support organizations and initiatives that rigorously assess their effectiveness and adjust their strategies based on evidence.

9. Moral Considerations: Effective altruism acknowledges that there are complex moral questions involved in allocating resources to help others. It encourages individuals to reflect on ethical dilemmas and trade-offs while striving to do the most good overall.

10. The "Effective Altruism Pledge": Some individuals formally commit to the principles of effective altruism by taking the "Effective Altruism Pledge," which involves dedicating a significant portion of one's resources, such as income or time, to high-impact causes.

11. Global Cooperation: Effective altruism recognizes that many global challenges require coordinated efforts on a large scale. It encourages cooperation and collaboration among individuals, organizations, and governments to address pressing issues.

Effective altruism is a dynamic and evolving movement that draws from various fields, including ethics, economics, and social science. Its key concepts are designed to guide individuals and organizations in their efforts to make a positive and meaningful difference in the world by focusing on what truly works and matters most.

# A critique
Effective altruism (EA) has garnered significant attention and support for its goal of maximizing positive impact through evidence-based and rational decision-making. However, like any philosophical or practical approach, it is not without its critiques and criticisms. Here are some common critiques of effective altruism:

1. Utilitarian Ethical Framework: Effective altruism often employs a utilitarian ethical framework, which evaluates actions based on the principle of maximizing overall happiness or well-being. Critics argue that this framework may not adequately account for other moral considerations, such as rights, justice, and individual autonomy. They contend that focusing solely on utility can lead to morally objectionable outcomes in certain situations.

2. Neglect of Local and Personal Concerns: Some critics argue that effective altruism can lead to a neglect of local or personal concerns in favor of global or statistically optimal actions. They believe that individuals may have legitimate moral obligations to address issues closer to home or to support causes that resonate with them personally, even if those causes do not offer the highest expected impact.

3. Moral Trade-offs: Effective altruism often involves difficult moral trade-offs and prioritization of causes. Critics argue that these trade-offs may not always be straightforward or morally defensible. For example, allocating resources away from causes like arts, culture, or local community development in favor of global poverty alleviation can raise questions about the value of diverse human experiences.

4. Epistemic Challenges: Some critics raise concerns about the difficulty of accurately determining which interventions are the most effective. They argue that making predictions about the long-term consequences of actions is fraught with uncertainty and that relying too heavily on quantitative metrics can lead to flawed decision-making.

5. Risk Aversion: Effective altruism places a strong emphasis on mitigating global catastrophic risks and existential threats. Critics may argue that this focus on worst-case scenarios can lead to excessive risk aversion or neglect of more immediate and pressing issues.

6. Overemphasis on Earning to Give: While earning to give—choosing high-income careers to donate a significant portion of one's earnings—is a common strategy within effective altruism, some critics contend that it does not address the root causes of social problems and can be seen as a form of "money solves everything" thinking.

7. Insensitivity to Cultural and Contextual Differences: Effective altruism's emphasis on global optimization can sometimes overlook the importance of cultural, contextual, and individual differences in addressing problems and determining what is most valuable in various contexts.

8. Resource Allocation: Critics argue that effective altruism may lead to an oversaturation of resources in certain areas while neglecting underfunded or overlooked causes that may also have a significant impact on well-being.

It's important to note that critiques of effective altruism vary widely, and not all criticisms apply to every aspect of the movement. Effective altruists themselves engage in ongoing discussions and debates, acknowledging the complexity of moral decision-making and the need for continuous refinement of their principles and strategies.

While EA has made significant contributions to discussions about doing good in the world, it is not exempt from scrutiny and should be evaluated in light of these and other critiques to ensure that its principles align with individual values and ethical considerations.

# Andreas Malm
Andreas Malm is a Swedish environmental historian and social theorist known for his work on climate change, political ecology, and the intersections of climate science with politics and society. He has written extensively on topics related to climate change mitigation, capitalism, and the need for transformative action to address the climate crisis.

Here are some key aspects of Andreas Malm's work and contributions:

1. Climate Politics and Activism: Malm is known for his critical perspectives on climate politics and activism. He has argued that the mainstream approach to climate change, which relies heavily on market-based solutions and technological fixes, has been insufficient in addressing the urgent need for emissions reductions. He emphasizes the importance of political action and social movements in confronting the climate crisis.

2. Fossil Capital: One of Malm's notable books is "Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the Roots of Global Warming" (2015). In this book, he explores the historical connection between the development of steam power during the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent rise in greenhouse gas emissions. He argues that the capitalist system and its reliance on fossil fuels played a pivotal role in driving climate change.

3. Concept of "The Capitalocene": Malm is associated with the concept of the "Capitalocene," a term used to describe the current geological epoch characterized by the dominance of capitalism and its ecological consequences, including climate change. The concept challenges the notion that the Anthropocene (a term referring to the geological era shaped by human activities) should be solely attributed to all of humanity, arguing that it is more accurately linked to capitalist systems.

4. Climate Justice and Social Movements: Malm has been involved in discussions related to climate justice and the need to center marginalized communities and global South in climate action. He has also examined the role of social movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, in demanding transformative change to address climate change.

5. Academic Work: Malm has held academic positions and published research on topics related to climate change, including its historical roots, the social and political dimensions of climate mitigation, and the challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels.

Andreas Malm's work has contributed to critical discussions on the intersection of climate change, capitalism, and social justice. He advocates for a more radical approach to addressing climate change that challenges existing power structures and emphasizes the need for political action and systemic change to mitigate the effects of global warming.

# The Non Identity Problem
The "Non-Identity Problem" is a philosophical problem that arises in the context of ethics and discussions about the moral implications of actions that affect future generations, particularly when those actions have the potential to harm individuals in the future. The problem is closely related to the concept of intergenerational justice.

The Non-Identity Problem can be summarized as follows:

1. Future Generations: When considering actions or policies that might harm future generations, philosophers often analyze whether such actions are morally wrong or unjust. For example, environmental degradation, climate change, or certain reproductive choices may have implications for the well-being of individuals who will exist in the future.

2. Identity of Future Persons: The problem arises because the very identity of future individuals is influenced by the actions or policies in question. In other words, if different choices had been made in the past, different individuals would exist in the future. This creates a unique challenge when evaluating the moral rightness or wrongness of actions that affect future people.

3. Counterfactual Scenarios: To understand the Non-Identity Problem, consider a counterfactual scenario. If, for instance, a particular environmental policy had not been implemented, different people would exist in the future, potentially facing different challenges and benefits. Therefore, it is difficult to argue that those future individuals have been harmed by the policy since they would not have existed without it.

4. Moral Evaluation: The Non-Identity Problem raises questions about how to assess the moral responsibility for actions that affect future generations when the very existence and identity of those individuals depend on those actions. Traditional moral frameworks may struggle to provide clear answers.

5. Practical Implications: The problem has practical implications for various ethical and policy discussions, including environmental ethics, reproductive rights, and intergenerational equity. It challenges our intuitions about moral responsibility and the assessment of harm when future people are involved.

Ethicists and philosophers have proposed various approaches and solutions to the Non-Identity Problem, but it remains a complex and contentious issue in moral philosophy. Some argue that we should still consider the well-being of future generations and adopt policies that minimize harm, while others contend that the problem undermines traditional moral frameworks and requires a reevaluation of how we think about ethical obligations to future individuals.

# "The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity" 
is a book written by Toby Ord, a philosopher and ethicist known for his work on existential risks and the moral obligations associated with them. The book was published in 2020 and has garnered significant attention for its exploration of the challenges facing humanity and the potential threats to our long-term survival.

Key themes and ideas in "The Precipice" by Toby Ord include:

1. Existential Risks: Toby Ord discusses existential risks, which are threats that could lead to the extinction of humanity or the irreversible collapse of human civilization. These risks include natural disasters, pandemics, nuclear war, advanced artificial intelligence, and other potential global catastrophes.

2. Long-Term Impact: The book emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term consequences of our actions and decisions, particularly when it comes to technologies and policies that have the potential to shape the future of humanity. Ord argues that we have a moral responsibility to take these risks seriously.

3. Moral Imperative: Toby Ord contends that we have a moral imperative to reduce existential risks and ensure the continued survival and flourishing of humanity. He draws from both philosophical ethics and empirical analysis to make the case for prioritizing the mitigation of these risks.

4. Global Cooperation: The book highlights the need for global cooperation and coordination to address existential risks effectively. Ord discusses the challenges of collective action and the role of international institutions in managing global catastrophic threats.

5. The Great Filter: Ord explores the concept of the "Great Filter," which is a hypothesis in the context of the Fermi Paradox. It suggests that there may be a rare and difficult-to-surpass barrier that prevents intelligent civilizations from proliferating across the universe. The book considers existential risks as potential candidates for the Great Filter.

6. Ethical Considerations: Toby Ord delves into the ethical dimensions of existential risk reduction, including questions about how to weigh current versus future generations and the trade-offs involved in allocating resources to mitigate various risks.

7. Effective Altruism: The book is informed by the effective altruism movement, which emphasizes the use of reason and evidence to determine how to do the most good in the world. Toby Ord is a prominent figure in the effective altruism community, and his book aligns with the movement's principles.

"The Precipice" has been well-received for its thoughtful exploration of existential risks and its call to action to address these risks systematically. It has contributed to discussions about the long-term future of humanity, the role of ethics in decision-making, and the importance of safeguarding our species from potentially catastrophic events.

# The Expected Value Problem in Philosophy
The "Expected Value Problem" is a philosophical problem that arises in the context of decision theory and ethics. It deals with how individuals should make decisions when faced with uncertainty and potential outcomes with varying values or utilities. The problem is particularly relevant in situations where ethical considerations and moral values play a role in decision-making.

Here is an overview of the Expected Value Problem:

1. Uncertainty and Decision-Making: In many real-life situations, individuals must make decisions without complete knowledge of the outcomes and their probabilities. These situations involve uncertainty, and individuals often need to weigh the potential consequences of different choices.

2. Expected Value: The expected value of an action or decision is a mathematical concept used to quantify the average or expected outcome when considering all possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities. It is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing these values.

3. Maximizing Expected Value: One approach to decision-making is to maximize the expected value of one's actions. This means choosing the action that, on average, is expected to yield the highest value or utility. This approach is commonly used in economics and decision theory.

4. Ethical Considerations: The Expected Value Problem becomes more complex when ethical considerations are involved. In many situations, people have ethical values and moral principles that guide their decisions. These values may conflict with the goal of maximizing expected value, as some actions with higher expected values may be considered morally unacceptable.

5. Moral Dilemmas: The Expected Value Problem can lead to moral dilemmas when individuals face choices where the action with the highest expected value conflicts with their ethical principles or moral intuitions. This raises questions about how to reconcile ethical values with rational decision-making under uncertainty.

6. Variations in Ethical Frameworks: Different ethical frameworks may offer different solutions to the Expected Value Problem. For example, deontological ethics might emphasize adherence to moral rules or duties, even if it leads to suboptimal expected outcomes, while utilitarianism might prioritize maximizing overall happiness or well-being.

7. Prospect Theory: Prospect theory, developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, challenges the assumption that individuals always maximize expected value. It suggests that people tend to be risk-averse when it comes to potential losses and may make decisions based on heuristics rather than strict expected value calculations.

8. Philosophical Debate: Philosophers and ethicists engage in discussions about how to navigate the Expected Value Problem in ethical decision-making. They consider questions about the relative importance of expected outcomes, individual values, and the moral permissibility of actions.

In summary, the Expected Value Problem highlights the tension between rational decision-making based on expected value calculations and ethical considerations that may lead individuals to make choices that do not maximize expected value. It raises important questions about the relationship between ethics and decision theory and the role of values in determining how to act when faced with uncertainty.

# Pascal's Mugging Problem
Pascal's Mugging is a thought experiment in philosophy and decision theory that raises questions about how to make rational decisions in situations involving extremely unlikely or improbable events with potentially enormous consequences. It was formulated by philosopher Nick Bostrom, drawing inspiration from the famous mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal.

The thought experiment goes as follows:

Imagine a person who claims to have a magical ability to predict highly improbable events. This person approaches you and makes an extraordinary claim, saying that they can predict with certainty that a particular event with a very low probability will occur. The event they describe may be something like a specific, highly unlikely sequence of coin flips resulting in heads.

The person then asks you for a large sum of money (let's say a million dollars) as a bet, arguing that the potential payoff from this event is so astronomically high that even the extremely low probability of it happening justifies the bet. They claim that if you don't make the bet and the event actually occurs, you will have missed out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for an enormous gain.

However, the problem with Pascal's Mugging is that it highlights the challenge of assessing the credibility of such a claim. Even if the probability of the event is astronomically low (e.g., 1 in a trillion), the potential payoff (e.g., gaining a billion dollars) may seem so attractive that it becomes tempting to take the bet. On the other hand, the claim may also appear to be highly implausible or even absurd, given the extraordinary nature of the prediction.

The paradox raises questions about how individuals should make rational decisions in situations where the expected value (the potential payoff multiplied by the probability) is extremely high, but the credibility of the claimant is questionable. It challenges conventional decision theory, which might recommend against such a bet due to the low probability of success.

Philosophers and decision theorists have proposed various responses to Pascal's Mugging, including:

1. Rejecting the Assumption: Some argue that the scenario itself is so implausible that it should be dismissed as a hypothetical or thought experiment, and real-world decisions should not be based on such extreme scenarios.

2. Applying Bayesian Principles: Bayesian decision theory incorporates prior beliefs and the strength of evidence when assessing claims. In the case of Pascal's Mugging, Bayesian updating would involve considering the initial probability of the event and the credibility of the claimant.

3. Limiting Extrapolation: Some suggest that there should be a limit on how much one is willing to extrapolate based on extremely low-probability events, even if the potential payoffs are vast.

Pascal's Mugging serves as a thought-provoking exercise that challenges our intuitions about rational decision-making in the face of highly improbable and seemingly absurd claims. It underscores the complexities of decision theory and the need for careful consideration of evidence, credibility, and prior beliefs in real-world decision-making.

# Invention of Philanthropy
The concept of philanthropy, which involves the voluntary giving of resources, such as money, time, or expertise, for the purpose of promoting the well-being of others or addressing societal issues, has a long and complex history that spans across different cultures and time periods. While it is challenging to pinpoint the exact invention of philanthropy, we can trace its origins and development through various historical and cultural contexts.

1. Ancient Civilizations: Philanthropic activities can be traced back to ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and Chinese. In these societies, individuals, families, and rulers often engaged in acts of charity and beneficence, such as donating land, building public works, and providing for the poor.

2. Religious Traditions: Many religious traditions have played a significant role in the development of philanthropy. For example, the concept of charity and almsgiving is central to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and other religions. Religious teachings have often encouraged followers to help those in need.

3. Medieval Europe: During the Middle Ages, religious institutions and charitable orders were major providers of philanthropic services. The establishment of hospitals, orphanages, and almshouses was common during this period.

4. Renaissance and Enlightenment: The Renaissance and Enlightenment periods saw the emergence of secular philanthropy alongside religious charity. Wealthy individuals and patrons of the arts supported cultural and educational institutions, including museums, libraries, and universities.

5. 19th Century: The 19th century witnessed significant developments in philanthropy, driven in part by the industrial revolution and the accumulation of wealth by industrialists and entrepreneurs. Prominent philanthropists like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller donated vast sums to various causes, including education, healthcare, and libraries.

6. Establishment of Charitable Organizations: The 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the creation of charitable organizations and foundations dedicated to specific social or humanitarian causes. These organizations played a crucial role in structuring and formalizing philanthropic efforts.

7. Modern Philanthropy: Philanthropy has continued to evolve in the modern era, with individuals, corporations, and foundations playing significant roles in addressing contemporary societal challenges. The advent of technology and social media has made it easier for people to engage in philanthropic activities and support causes they are passionate about.

8. Philanthropy as a Global Phenomenon: Today, philanthropy is a global phenomenon, with contributions made to a wide range of causes, from poverty alleviation and education to environmental conservation and scientific research. International philanthropic efforts and collaborations are also common.

While philanthropy has ancient roots, its practice and forms have evolved over time to address the changing needs and complexities of society. The invention of philanthropy, therefore, cannot be attributed to a single individual or event but is the result of a long and ongoing history of individuals and communities coming together to improve the well-being of others and make positive contributions to society.

# Rhetoric of Economics
"The Rhetoric of Economics" is a book written by economist and philosopher Deirdre N. McCloskey. The book was originally published in 1985 and has since become influential in the fields of economics and philosophy of science. In "The Rhetoric of Economics," McCloskey explores and critiques the language, rhetoric, and persuasive techniques used by economists in their writing and communication.

Key themes and ideas in the book include:

1. The Role of Rhetoric: McCloskey argues that rhetoric, which involves the use of persuasive language and communication techniques, plays a significant role in the discipline of economics. Economists use rhetoric to present their theories, persuade their peers, and influence public policy.

2. Persuasion in Economic Discourse: The book delves into how economists use various forms of persuasion, including storytelling, analogies, metaphors, and narrative structures, to convey their ideas effectively. McCloskey suggests that economists often rely on persuasive techniques to make their arguments more compelling.

3. Economics as a Rhetorical Science: McCloskey challenges the idea that economics is purely objective and value-free. She contends that economists make normative judgments and engage in persuasive rhetoric, which means that economics is not solely a "hard science" but also a "rhetorical science."

4. The Rhetorical Turn in Economics: McCloskey's work has been associated with the "rhetorical turn" in economics, which encourages economists to acknowledge the role of language and persuasion in their discipline. This perspective calls for a more open and reflective approach to economic discourse.

5. Interdisciplinary Approach: McCloskey draws on insights from the fields of philosophy, rhetoric, and the history of science to analyze and critique economic rhetoric. She emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary thinking in understanding how economics is practiced and communicated.

"The Rhetoric of Economics" has had a lasting impact on discussions within the economics profession. It has prompted economists and scholars to consider the ways in which language and persuasion shape economic theories and policy recommendations. McCloskey's work has also contributed to broader discussions about the philosophy of science, the social sciences, and the nature of academic discourse.

# A Critique of Philanthropy
Critiques of philanthropy have been a topic of discussion in various contexts, including academia, civil society, and public discourse. While philanthropy is often associated with noble intentions and positive contributions to society, there are several critiques and concerns associated with it:

1. Undemocratic Influence: One common critique is that philanthropy can exert undue influence on public policy and decision-making. Wealthy individuals, foundations, and corporations can use their financial resources to shape political agendas and public priorities, potentially bypassing democratic processes and accountability.

2. Unequal Distribution of Power: The concentration of wealth in philanthropic organizations and the ability to allocate resources at their discretion can reinforce existing power structures. Critics argue that this can perpetuate social inequalities and limit opportunities for meaningful community input.

3. Lack of Accountability: Some critics argue that philanthropic organizations are not subject to the same level of accountability and transparency as government institutions. They may make decisions about resource allocation without sufficient oversight or public scrutiny.

4. Preservation of the Status Quo: Philanthropy can sometimes be focused on maintaining the status quo rather than addressing root causes of social problems. Foundations and donors may support initiatives that do not challenge systemic issues or may prioritize projects that align with their personal or corporate interests.

5. Erosion of Public Responsibility: When philanthropic organizations take on roles traditionally performed by governments, such as providing social services, some argue that it can lead to a reduction in public funding for these services. This can potentially weaken the social safety net and public institutions.

6. Influence on Research and Academia: Philanthropic organizations can fund academic research, which may lead to concerns about potential biases or conflicts of interest in research findings. Critics worry that certain research agendas may be influenced by donor priorities.

7. Tax Deductions and Tax Avoidance: The tax benefits associated with philanthropic giving can lead to concerns about tax avoidance strategies by wealthy individuals and corporations. Some argue that tax deductions for charitable contributions disproportionately benefit the affluent.

8. Donor Intent vs. Community Needs: Donor-driven philanthropy may prioritize the intentions and values of donors over the actual needs and priorities of communities. This can lead to a mismatch between where resources are directed and where they are most needed.

9. Short-Term Solutions: Philanthropy often focuses on short-term projects and initiatives, which may not address the underlying structural issues contributing to societal problems. Critics argue for a more systemic and long-term approach to social change.

10. Lack of Representation: Philanthropic boards and decision-making structures may lack diversity and representation from the communities and populations being served, potentially leading to disconnected or paternalistic approaches.

It's important to note that critiques of philanthropy do not necessarily negate its positive impact. Many philanthropic organizations and individuals work diligently to address pressing social issues and make a positive difference in the world. However, these critiques highlight the need for thoughtful reflection, transparency, and accountability within the philanthropic sector to ensure that resources are allocated effectively and in a manner that aligns with broader societal goals and values. Efforts to address these concerns may lead to more ethical and equitable philanthropic practices.
