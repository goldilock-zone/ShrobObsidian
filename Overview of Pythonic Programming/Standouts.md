1.  This library contains the zen of python
2. Triple quotes can be used for several lines of code
3. Continuation of code into the nest line using a forward slash. We can't do stupid things with this.
4. Using docstrings is normally good practice
5. input() function can be a nice way to debug code
6. Dummy variable using _
7. Enums in python, using enum.Enum. We can iterate over the class after using it.
	1. enum.auto() for each choice
8. Chaining logical operators is similar to chaining with and
9. Anonymous functions: lambda functions
10. for....if
11. Pessimist vs the Optimist's approach
12. Use try except for each possible type of error, in each section of the code
13. Dictionary comprehension exists
14. List generator expression is basically a tuple comprehension
15. We can use list comprehension even with a complex function
16. * operator is used to unpack list like objects.
17. % operator is the string substitution operators
18. str() is a string constructor
19. # can be used as a word prefix
20. Identifiers can even be used for functions
21. eval() can run code that you send in a string
22. literal_eval() is safer
23. isinstance(obj, type)
24. Fraction(p,q)
25. Remember that you can multiply a list several times
26. Strings in python are immutable
27. Global variable is directly visible only within the module in which itâ€™s defined
28.
