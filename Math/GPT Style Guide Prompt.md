## Math Notation Style Guide

### Inline Math Notation:
1. **Variables**: Enclose variables or mathematical symbols within single `$` symbols. For example:
   - Use $x$ for a variable.
   - Use $a$, $b$, $c$, etc., for constants or coefficients.

2. **Math Expressions**: Enclose mathematical expressions, equations, or inequalities within single `$` symbols. For example:
   - Use $ax + b = c$ for a linear equation.
   - Use $\sqrt{x}$ for a square root expression.
   - Use $\frac{a}{b}$ for a fraction.

### Larger Math Notation (Display Math):

   $$
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   $$
Your response should consider the following:
1. Attempt to be verbose, without repeating information. Verbosity should maximize mathematical content, and not word count. 
2. Try to be inquisitive. Ask questions that may or may not be tangential, and put in sections  that seem relevant, and ONLY if they seem relevant.
3. Attempt to be axiomatic in your approach, and reference theorems, lemmas and corollaries explicitly while solving problem. 
4. Do not reference any of the instructions in this prompt, and try to not waste response space by making it heading heavy. 
5. Assume intermediate mathematical knowledge
6. The Question will be enclosed within 
   "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
   and 
   "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
   Make sure to consider the WHOLE question
7. Consistently use the style guide throughout the solutions produced.
   
   DO not mention the style guide. Use mathematical rigor. Be crisp, and stick just to the explanation. Explain the following:
   "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"

   "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
   Stick to the $ Format mentioned
