Properties of the solution to a Rubik's cube
1. Given any scrambled configuration of the cube, there is a unique page in the manual corresponding to that configuration.
2. There is a method for looking up a particular configuration
3. Along with each configuration, a list of available moves is included. In each case, the page number for outcome of  each move is included, along with information about whether the corresponding move takes us closer to or farther away from the solution

There's apparently a Big Books solutions manual for the Rubik's cube puzzle
- Well we can't actually make such a book
- But it's a good thought experiment
- A big book is the map of a group

We  can define a certain game, and define rules of the moves that are playable in that game. The different combinations of those moves would aid us in make a collection of moves that "preserve the footprint the initial state".
To check that such a set of actions forma group, we can check for the rules of a group. [[Lecture 1 - What is a group#^9b4df1]]

- A Group is inherently just a set (of moves or actions)

# Group generators
Generators in the context of group theory are a fundamental concept. A generator or a set of generators for a group is a subset of the group's elements from which every element of the group can be expressed. In other words, the entire group can be constructed from these generators through the group's operation (which is often multiplication or addition, depending on the group).

Let's be more precise. Consider a group $G$ with a binary operation $*$. A subset $S \subseteq G$ is said to generate $G$ if every element of $G$ can be written as a finite product (or sum) of elements of $S$ and their inverses. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$ G = \langle S \rangle = \{ s_1^{n_1} * s_2^{n_2} * \ldots * s_k^{n_k} \,|\, s_i \in S, n_i \in \mathbb{Z}, k \in \mathbb{N} \} $$

Here, $s_i^{n_i}$ denotes the $n_i$-th power of $s_i$ (which can be thought of as repeated application of the group operation, and negative powers indicate the use of the inverse element).

### Types of Generators

1. **Single Generator (Cyclic Groups)**: If $G$ can be generated by a single element, i.e., $G = \langle a \rangle$ for some $a \in G$, then $G$ is a cyclic group. Every element of $G$ can be expressed as some power of $a$. 

2. **Multiple Generators**: For more complex groups, multiple generators might be required. For example, in the symmetric group $S_3$, the entire group can be generated by two elements, typically permutations like $(1\,2)$ and $(1\,2\,3)$.

### Examples

1. **Integers under Addition**: The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition is a cyclic group generated by $1$. That is, $\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1 \rangle$, since every integer can be expressed as a sum or difference of $1$s.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Consider the group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ under addition modulo $n$. This group is also cyclic and can be generated by $1$ (modulo $n$).

3. **Rotational Symmetry**: The group of rotations of a regular polygon with $n$ sides is generated by the rotation of $\frac{360^\circ}{n}$. 

In group theory, understanding the generators of a group is crucial because it gives us a compact way to describe and work with the entire group. The concept of generators is closely linked with the structure of the group and can often reveal deep insights about the group's properties.

# Cayley Graphs
A Cayley graph is a vivid representation of a group, capturing its structure through the lens of geometry. To conceptualize a Cayley graph in plain text, consider these elements:
(Note: A group is not defined by its Cayley graph)
1. **Group Elements as Nodes:** Each element of the group is depicted as a distinct node or vertex in the graph. 

2. **Generators as Directed Edges:** Select a set of generators for the group. These generators serve as the basis for constructing the graph. For each generator, we draw directed edges between nodes. An edge from node $a$ to node $b$ with label $g$ (where $g$ is a generator) signifies that $b = ag$ in the group operation.

3. **Symmetry and Repetition:** The Cayley graph reflects the internal symmetry of the group. If the group is finite, the graph will be a finite, usually symmetric, structure where patterns repeat based on the group's operation. In an infinite group, the graph extends indefinitely but still shows repeating patterns.

Let's consider an abstract example using a simple group, such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, the integers modulo 3, with the standard addition operation. The group $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$ has a simple set of generators, say $\{1\}$. 

The Cayley graph for $\mathbb{Z}_3$ with generator $\{1\}$ would look like this in a plain text description:

- **Nodes:** Three nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2.
- **Edges:** Directed edges from each node to the next, representing addition by 1 modulo 3.
  - An edge from 0 to 1 (0 + 1 = 1).
  - An edge from 1 to 2 (1 + 1 = 2).
  - An edge from 2 back to 0 (2 + 1 = 3, which is 0 modulo 3).

This forms a simple, circular graph with three nodes and three edges, each looping back in a cycle - a graphical echo of the cyclical nature of $\mathbb{Z}_3$.
The edges have directional arrows that let us know in which direction moves are allowed

# Note:
- The groups may be isomorphic to each other

# Klein 4 Group
The Klein Four-Group, denoted often as $V_4$ or $K_4$, resides in the fascinating world of group theory, a branch of abstract algebra. This group is a simple yet intriguing example that illustrates fundamental concepts in group theory.

### Definition and Structure

The Klein Four-Group is defined as the set $\{e, a, b, c\}$ with a binary operation, typically multiplication, satisfying specific properties. The group's structure can be encapsulated in its multiplication table:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\cdot & e & a & b & c \\
\hline
e & e & a & b & c \\
a & a & e & c & b \\
b & b & c & e & a \\
c & c & b & a & e \\
\end{array}
$$

In this table, $e$ represents the identity element, and each element is its own inverse (i.e., $a \cdot a = e$, $b \cdot b = e$, and $c \cdot c = e$).

### Properties

1. **Abelian Nature**: The Klein Four-Group is abelian (or commutative), meaning that $g \cdot h = h \cdot g$ for all $g, h$ in $V_4$. This can be observed directly from the symmetry in its multiplication table.

2. **Order of the Group**: The order of $V_4$ is $4$, which is the number of its elements. 

3. **Order of Elements**: Except for the identity element $e$, all other elements have an order of $2$. In group theory, the order of an element $g$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $g^n = e$.

4. **Isomorphism to $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$**: The Klein Four-Group is isomorphic to the Cartesian product of two copies of the cyclic group of order $2$, denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. An isomorphism can be established by mapping elements of $V_4$ to ordered pairs in $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$.

### Significance

The Klein Four-Group serves as a fundamental example in group theory, demonstrating the concept of a non-cyclic group of the smallest non-prime order. It's instrumental in understanding the direct product of groups and appears in various contexts, such as in the study of symmetries and in the theory of finite fields.

In the symphony of group theory, $V_4$ plays a delicate yet essential role, offering a glimpse into the rich tapestry of algebraic structures. Its simplicity belies its power in illuminating the path to more complex and abstract algebraic constructs.


# D3 Group
### Structure of $D_3$

1. **Elements**: $D_3$ has six elements, split into rotations and reflections:
   - Rotations: $r_0$ (identity), $r_1$ (120 degrees), $r_2$ (240 degrees).
   - Reflections: $s_0$, $s_1$, $s_2$ (over three axes).

2. **Operations**: The operation in $D_3$ combines these rotations and reflections and is associative.

3. **Identity Element**: The identity element is $r_0$, representing no change.

4. **Inverses**: Each element has an inverse in $D_3$:
   - Rotations: Inverse of $r_1$ is $r_2$ and vice versa.
   - Reflections: Each $s_i$ is its own inverse, i.e., $s_i^{-1} = s_i$.

5. **Closure**: $D_3$ is closed under its operation, meaning combining any two elements results in another element within $D_3$.

### Group Table

Constructing the group table for $D_3$ helps visualize the results of combining elements:
$$

\begin{array}{c|cccccc}
\cdot & r_0 & r_1 & r_2 & s_0 & s_1 & s_2 \\
\hline
r_0 & r_0 & r_1 & r_2 & s_0 & s_1 & s_2 \\
r_1 & r_1 & r_2 & r_0 & s_1 & s_2 & s_0 \\
r_2 & r_2 & r_0 & r_1 & s_2 & s_0 & s_1 \\
s_0 & s_0 & s_2 & s_1 & r_0 & r_2 & r_1 \\
s_1 & s_1 & s_0 & s_2 & r_1 & r_0 & r_2 \\
s_2 & s_2 & s_1 & s_0 & r_2 & r_1 & r_0 \\
\end{array}

$$
### Mathematical Properties

- **Non-Abelian Nature**: $D_3$ is non-abelian, indicating that the order of operations matters, e.g., $r_1 \cdot s_1 \neq s_1 \cdot r_1$.
- **Subgroups**: It includes several subgroups, including itself and the trivial group. Notably, the rotational subgroup $\{r_0, r_1, r_2\}$.

### Representations and Applications

- **Geometric Representation**: $D_3$ can be visualized with a regular triangle, identifying its symmetries.
- **Applications**: This group finds use in crystallography, molecular symmetry, and art.

In summary, $D_3$ exemplifies the intertwining of group theory and geometry, showcasing the profound connections between abstract algebra and the physical world.

# Properties of Cayley Graph

Cayley graphs are a fascinating intersection of group theory and graph theory. Let's delve into their properties using the elegance of mathematical notation. 

A Cayley graph, denoted as $\Gamma(G, S)$, is constructed from a group $G$ and a generating set $S$ of $G$. This graph encodes the structure of $G$ in a visual and combinatorial manner. Here are some key properties:

1. **Vertices Represent Group Elements**: Each element $g \in G$ is represented as a vertex in the graph. Thus, the number of vertices in $\Gamma(G, S)$ is equal to the order of $G$. Formally, if $|G| = n$, then $\Gamma(G, S)$ has $n$ vertices.

2. **Edges Defined by Generators**: For two elements $g, h \in G$, there is a directed edge from $g$ to $h$ if there exists an $s \in S$ such that $gs = h$. In simpler terms, you can move from one vertex to another using the elements of $S$. 

3. **Regular Graph**: If $S$ is a symmetric generating set (meaning if $s \in S$, then $s^{-1} \in S$), then $\Gamma(G, S)$ is an undirected graph. Moreover, it is $|S|$-regular, meaning each vertex has exactly $|S|$ neighbors.

4. **Reflects Group Properties**: The structure of $\Gamma(G, S)$ can reveal much about $G$. For instance, if $G$ is abelian, then the Cayley graph has certain symmetries. The connectivity and diameter of the graph can also provide insights into the algebraic properties of $G$.

5. **Labeling Edges**: Edges in Cayley graphs are often labeled with the generator that corresponds to the multiplication. This labeling provides a clearer representation of the group operations.

6. **Cycles and Symmetry**: Cayley graphs of finite groups have a high degree of symmetry. They are vertex-transitive, meaning that for any two vertices $v$ and $w$, there is an [[Automorphisms]] of the graph mapping $v$ to $w$. 

# Identity Theorem
The theorem presented is a fundamental concept in group theory, a branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures known as groups. The theorem states that if an element $g$ of a group has the property that $gx = x$ for some action $x$, then $g$ is the identity element of the group. The identity element is defined as the element that, when combined with any element $h$ of the group, leaves $h$ unchanged, i.e., $gh = h$.

Here is a proof of the theorem:

**Proof:**

Given that $gx = x$, we need to show that $g$ is the identity element, i.e., for all elements $h$ in the group, $gh = h$.

Let's take any element $h$ in the group. Since $g$ acts as the identity on $x$, we want to show that this action can be generalized to any $h$.

By the group axioms, each element $h$ has an inverse, denoted by $h^{-1}$, such that $h^{-1}h = e$, where $e$ is the actual identity element of the group.

Now consider the product $gh$. We can write $h$ as $e \cdot h$ (since $e$ is the identity, $eh = h$ for any $h$ in the group).

But we are given that $gx = x$ for some action $x$, and we can use this property by setting $x = h^{-1}h$. Thus, we have $g(h^{-1}h) = h^{-1}h$.

Applying the associative property of group multiplication (which states that for any elements $a, b, c$ in the group, $a(bc) = (ab)c$), we get:

$$ g(h^{-1}h) = (gh^{-1})h $$

Now, because $g(h^{-1}h) = h^{-1}h$, we can substitute back to get:

$$ (gh^{-1})h = h^{-1}h $$

This implies that $gh^{-1}$ must be the identity element $e$ because it leaves $h$ unchanged when multiplied by it. Hence:

$$ gh^{-1} = e $$

Multiplying both sides by $h$ on the right, we have:

$$ gh^{-1}h = eh $$

Simplifying both sides using the definition of the inverse and the identity, we get:

$$ g = h $$

This proves that $g$ must be the identity element, as it satisfies the condition $gh = h$ for all $h$ in the group. Thus, the theorem is proven. 

The elegance of this proof lies in the inherent symmetry of group actions and the pivotal role of the identity element, which acts as a keystone preserving the structure of the group under its operations.
