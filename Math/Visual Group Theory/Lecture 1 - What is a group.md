	- There is a predefined list of moves that never changes: The list of these actions are called generators
	- Every move is reversible
	- Every move is deterministic
	- Moves can be combined in any sequence. Those sequences are also moves.
	Sometimes, some moves are indistinguishable from each other

# Axioms of Group Theory
In group theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four fundamental properties—called group axioms—are satisfied. These axioms are:

1. **Closure**: For all elements $a$ and $b$ in the group $G$, the result of the operation, denoted as $a * b$, is also in $G$.

2. **Associativity**: For all elements $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $G$, the equation $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$ holds.

3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that for every element $a$ in $G$, the equation $e * a = a * e = a$ holds.

4. **Inverse Element**: For each element $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.

These axioms define the structure of a group, a central concept in abstract algebra. Groups provide a unified way of studying symmetry, operations, and transformations in various mathematical contexts, from number theory to geometry and beyond.
