# **Symmetric Groups**

The concept of symmetric groups is a fundamental topic in abstract algebra, particularly in group theory. Symmetric groups are associated with the set of all permutations of a finite set, and they play a crucial role in various mathematical and combinatorial applications.

Let's delve into the formal definition and properties of symmetric groups:

**Definition:**
Given a finite set $X$, the symmetric group, denoted as $S_X$ or simply $S_n$ where $n$ is the number of elements in set $X$, is the group of all bijections (permutations) from $X$ to itself. In other words, $S_X$ consists of all possible ways to rearrange the elements of set $X$ while preserving the set's cardinality.

**Elements of Symmetric Groups:**
- An element of the symmetric group $S_X$ is a permutation, which is a one-to-one and onto function from $X$ to itself. Mathematically, an element $\sigma$ of $S_X$ can be represented as $\sigma: X \rightarrow X$.

**Group Structure:**
- The operation in the symmetric group is the composition of permutations. If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are two permutations in $S_X$, then their composition $\sigma \circ \tau$ is also a permutation in $S_X$.

**Order of a Symmetric Group:**
- The order (size) of the symmetric group $S_X$ is given by $|S_X| = n!$, where $n$ is the cardinality of set $X$. This is because there are $n!$ possible ways to arrange $n$ distinct elements.

**Cyclic Notation:**
- One common way to represent permutations in $S_n$ is using cyclic notation. In cyclic notation, a permutation is expressed as a product of disjoint cycles. For example, the permutation $(123)(45)$ represents the mapping: $1\mapsto2$, $2\mapsto3$, $3\mapsto1$, $4\mapsto5$, and $5\mapsto4$. Cyclic notation is useful for simplifying complex permutations.

**Properties:**
- Symmetric groups are non-abelian groups for $n \geq 3$. This means that in general, the order of composition matters (i.e., $\sigma \circ \tau$ may not be equal to $\tau \circ \sigma$).
- The identity element in $S_X$ is the identity permutation, denoted as $e$ or $(1)(2)(3)\ldots(n)$, which leaves all elements unchanged.
- The inverse of a permutation $\sigma$ is another permutation $\sigma^{-1}$ such that $\sigma \circ \sigma^{-1} = \sigma^{-1} \circ \sigma = e$.

**Cayley's Theorem:**
- Cayley's theorem states that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group $S_X$. This theorem illustrates the power and generality of symmetric groups in representing arbitrary groups.

**Permutation Group:**
- Symmetric groups are an example of permutation groups. A permutation group is a subgroup of a symmetric group, and it is generated by a set of permutations.

**Applications:**
- Symmetric groups find applications in combinatorics, group theory, and algebraic structures. They are used to study permutation puzzles, symmetric polynomials, and group actions, among other mathematical areas.

In summary, symmetric groups are a fundamental concept in group theory that capture the idea of permuting elements of a set. They provide a rich framework for studying permutations and have broad applications across various branches of mathematics.

# Disjoint Cycles
**Theorems about Disjoint Cycles and Commutativity of Disjoint Cycles in Symmetric Groups**

In the context of symmetric groups, there are important theorems related to disjoint cycles and the commutativity of disjoint cycles. These theorems provide insights into the structure and behavior of permutations in symmetric groups.

**Theorem 1: Decomposition into Disjoint Cycles**

Let $\sigma$ be a permutation in $S_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Then, $\sigma$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of disjoint cycles, up to the order of the cycles.

*Proof*: 
Consider any permutation $\sigma \in S_n$. Start with an element $x_1$ in the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ and apply $\sigma$ repeatedly to generate a cycle. Specifically, let $x_2 = \sigma(x_1)$, $x_3 = \sigma(x_2)$, and so on, until we reach an element $x_k$ such that $\sigma(x_k) = x_1$. This forms a cycle $(x_1 x_2 \ldots x_k)$. Remove these elements from the set, and repeat the process with the remaining elements until all elements are exhausted. This process decomposes $\sigma$ into disjoint cycles.

The uniqueness of this decomposition follows from the fact that any permutation can be written as a unique product of disjoint cycles, where the order of cycles in the product does not matter.

**Theorem 2: Commutativity of Disjoint Cycles**

Let $\sigma$ and $\tau$ be two disjoint cycles in $S_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Then, $\sigma$ and $\tau$ commute, i.e., $\sigma \circ \tau = \tau \circ \sigma$.

*Proof*:
Disjoint cycles operate on distinct elements of the set. Therefore, the order in which these cycles are composed does not affect the final result. Let $\sigma = (a_1 a_2 \ldots a_k)$ and $\tau = (b_1 b_2 \ldots b_m)$, where $a_i$ and $b_j$ are distinct elements from the set. Since $a_i$ and $b_j$ are different, $\sigma(b_j) = b_j$ and $\tau(a_i) = a_i$. 

Now, consider the composition $\sigma \circ \tau$. For any element $x$ in the set, we have:

- If $x$ is not in the cycles of $\sigma$ or $\tau$, then $\sigma(x) = x$ and $\tau(x) = x$, so $\sigma \circ \tau (x) = x = \tau \circ \sigma (x)$.
- If $x$ is in the cycle of $\sigma$ but not in the cycle of $\tau$, then $\sigma(x) = a_i$ and $\tau(x) = x$, so $\sigma \circ \tau (x) = \sigma(a_i) = a_i$ and $\tau \circ \sigma (x) = \tau(a_i) = a_i$.
- Similarly, if $x$ is in the cycle of $\tau$ but not in the cycle of $\sigma$, then $\sigma \circ \tau (x) = x$ and $\tau \circ \sigma (x) = x$.

Since $\sigma \circ \tau (x) = \tau \circ \sigma (x)$ for all elements $x$ in the set, we conclude that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ commute.

**Corollary: Commutativity of Disjoint Cycles in Symmetric Groups**

The commutativity property of disjoint cycles can be extended to symmetric groups. If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are disjoint cycles in $S_n$, then $\sigma$ and $\tau$ commute within $S_n$, i.e., $\sigma \circ \tau = \tau \circ \sigma$.

*Proof (Using Theorem 2)*:
Since $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are disjoint cycles, they operate on distinct elements of the set. By Theorem 2, within their respective cycles, they commute. Therefore, their composition $\sigma \circ \tau$ and $\tau \circ \sigma$ also commute within $S_n$.

These theorems and corollaries provide valuable insights into the structure and behavior of permutations, particularly in the context of symmetric groups. They are fundamental in understanding how permutations can be decomposed into cycles and how these cycles interact with each other.

# **Combining Permutations in Cycle Notation**

In the study of permutations and symmetric groups, it is often necessary to combine or compose permutations. One common and compact way to represent permutations is through cycle notation. Let's explore how to combine permutations in cycle notation.

**Definition: Cycle Notation**

In cycle notation, a permutation is represented as a product of disjoint cycles. Each cycle lists the elements that are moved by the permutation. For example, the permutation $(123)(45)$ indicates the following mappings:
- $1$ is sent to $2$
- $2$ is sent to $3`
- $3$ is sent to $1`
- $4$ is sent to $5`
- $5$ is sent to $4`

Now, let's discuss how to combine or compose two permutations in cycle notation.

**Combining Permutations in Cycle Notation**

When you have two permutations represented in cycle notation, say $\alpha$ and $\beta$, you can combine or compose them by performing the following steps:

1. Apply $\alpha$ first and then $\beta$: To combine $\alpha$ and $\beta$, apply $\alpha$ to the elements as specified in its cycles, and then apply $\beta$ to the result.

2. Express the composition in cycle notation: To represent the composed permutation in cycle notation, start with the elements that were affected by either $\alpha$ or $\beta$. Trace the effect of $\alpha$ on these elements, and then apply the effect of $\beta$. Any elements that were not affected by either permutation remain unchanged.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

**Example: Combining Permutations**

Suppose we have two permutations $\alpha = (123)$ and $\beta = (45)$, and we want to find their composition $\alpha \circ \beta$.

1. Apply $\alpha$ to the elements first:
   - $\alpha$ sends $1$ to $2$, $2$ to $3`, and $3$ to $1$.
   - $\alpha$ leaves $4$ and $5$ unchanged.

2. Apply $\beta$ to the result of $\alpha$:
   - $\beta$ sends $4$ to $5$ and $5$ to $4$.
   - $\beta$ leaves $1$, $2$, and $3$ unchanged.

Now, express the composed permutation in cycle notation:
- The elements $1$, $2$, and $3$ were affected by $\alpha$ and $\beta$, so they form a cycle: $(123)$.
- The elements $4$ and $5$ were affected by $\beta$ but not by $\alpha$, so they form a separate cycle: $(45)$.

Therefore, $\alpha \circ \beta = (123)(45)$.

**Properties:**
- The order of composition matters; in general, $\alpha \circ \beta \neq \beta \circ \alpha$.
- Composing a permutation with its inverse yields the identity permutation: $\alpha \circ \alpha^{-1} = \text{Identity}$.

In conclusion, combining permutations in cycle notation involves applying each permutation in the specified order and expressing the result as a product of disjoint cycles. This method provides a concise and intuitive way to represent the composed permutation.

# **Transposition**

A transposition is a specific type of permutation commonly used in the study of symmetric groups and permutations. It represents a simple interchange of two elements while leaving all other elements unchanged. Let's formally define and explore the properties of transpositions.

**Definition: Transposition**

In mathematics, a transposition is a permutation that swaps the positions of exactly two elements in a sequence or set, while keeping all other elements fixed. It can be represented as a cycle of length 2.

**Notation:**
- A transposition is denoted as $(a\; b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two elements being interchanged.

**Example:**
- The transposition $(3\; 5)$, for instance, swaps the positions of elements 3 and 5 while leaving all other elements unchanged.

**Properties and Observations:**

1. **Inverse of Itself:**
   - A transposition is its own inverse. This means that applying the same transposition twice will bring the elements back to their original positions.
   - Formally, $(a\; b) \circ (a\; b) = \text{Identity}$, where the identity permutation leaves all elements unchanged.

2. **Commutativity:**
   - Transpositions commute with each other, which means that the order of applying transpositions does not matter.
   - For example, $(a\; b) \circ (c\; d) = (c\; d) \circ (a\; b)$.

3. **Transpositions Generate the Symmetric Group:**
   - Any permutation in a symmetric group $S_n$ can be expressed as a product of transpositions.
   - This property is known as the "transposition decomposition theorem."

4. **Parity:**
   - The concept of parity, whether a permutation is even or odd, is closely related to transpositions.
   - A permutation is considered even if it can be expressed as an even number of transpositions and odd if it requires an odd number of transpositions.

**Application:**

Transpositions are fundamental in the study of permutations, symmetric groups, and group theory. They provide a simple and elegant way to represent permutations and understand their properties. Transpositions are often used as building blocks to analyze more complex permutations and to prove theorems about symmetric groups.

In summary, a transposition is a specific type of permutation that swaps the positions of two elements while leaving all others unchanged. They have interesting properties and are essential tools in the study of permutations and symmetric groups.

# **The Group $S_n$ is Generated by Transpositions**

In the realm of group theory, particularly when studying symmetric groups, it is essential to understand that the symmetric group $S_n$, consisting of all permutations of $n$ elements, can be generated by transpositions. This fundamental concept reveals that transpositions play a pivotal role in shaping the structure of $S_n$. Let's delve into this notion and explore its implications.

**Definition: Transposition**

A transposition is a permutation that swaps the positions of exactly two elements while keeping all other elements fixed. It can be represented as a cycle of length 2. For instance, $(i\; j)$ represents a transposition that swaps elements $i$ and $j$.

**Generating $S_n$ with Transpositions**

The key idea behind generating $S_n$ with transpositions is that you can create any permutation in $S_n$ by composing (multiplying) transpositions. To illustrate this, let's consider a general approach:

1. Start with the identity permutation: The identity permutation in $S_n$ leaves all elements unchanged.

2. Use transpositions to modify the identity: You can construct any permutation $\sigma$ in $S_n$ by successively multiplying it with appropriate transpositions.

   - For example, to move element $i$ to position $j$, you can multiply $\sigma$ by the transposition $(i\; j)$. This effectively swaps the positions of $i$ and $j$ in $\sigma$.

   - By applying different transpositions in this manner, you can manipulate the elements of $\sigma$ to match the desired permutation.

3. Repeat until $\sigma$ matches the desired permutation: Continue applying transpositions as needed to achieve the desired permutation.

**The Transposition Decomposition Theorem**

The process described above is encapsulated in what is known as the Transposition Decomposition Theorem, which states that any permutation in $S_n$ can be expressed as a product (composition) of transpositions.

This theorem underscores the power of transpositions as generators for $S_n$. It also highlights the fact that transpositions are fundamental building blocks for permutations. While it may require multiple transpositions to create a specific permutation, the notion that transpositions alone can generate all permutations in $S_n$ is a profound and foundational result in group theory.

**Applications and Implications**

1. **Understanding Symmetric Groups:** Recognizing that $S_n$ can be generated by transpositions is crucial for understanding the structure and properties of symmetric groups.

2. **Permutation Puzzles:** In combinatorics and recreational mathematics, this concept is employed to analyze and solve permutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube.

3. **Group Theory:** It provides a fundamental insight into the concept of group generation and the interplay between simple elements (transpositions) and complex structures (permutations).

In conclusion, the group $S_n$, comprising all permutations of $n$ elements, is generated by transpositions. This means that transpositions serve as fundamental tools for creating and understanding permutations within $S_n$, and the Transposition Decomposition Theorem formalizes this important concept in group theory

# **Prove that the Parity of the Number of Transpositions of a Fixed Permutation is Unique**

To prove that the parity (even or odd) of the number of transpositions required to transform a fixed permutation into another fixed permutation is unique, we will rely on fundamental concepts from group theory.

**Definition: Parity of a Permutation**

The parity of a permutation is a concept that categorizes permutations into two groups: even and odd. A permutation is considered even if it can be expressed as an even number of transpositions and odd if it requires an odd number of transpositions.

**Theorem: Uniqueness of Parity**

Let $\sigma$ and $\tau$ be two fixed permutations of a set $X$. The parity of the number of transpositions required to transform $\sigma$ into $\tau$ is uniquely determined.

*Proof*:

1. **Existence of a Transposition Sequence**: First, we need to establish that there exists a sequence of transpositions that can transform $\sigma$ into $\tau$. This can be done by considering the cycles of $\sigma$ and $\tau$.

   - Each cycle of length $k$ in $\sigma$ can be transformed into the same cycle in $\tau$ using $k-1$ transpositions.
   - For example, if $\sigma = (123)$ and $\tau = (231)$, you can transform $\sigma$ into $\tau$ using two transpositions: $(12)$ and $(13)$.

2. **Unique Parity of Transpositions**: Now, we prove the uniqueness of parity.

   - Let $n$ be the total number of elements in the set. Consider the cycle decomposition of $\sigma$ and $\tau$ into disjoint cycles. The number of transpositions required to transform each cycle of $\sigma$ into the corresponding cycle of $\tau$ is uniquely determined by the length of the cycle.
   
   - If a cycle in $\sigma$ has an even length $k$, it will require $k-1$ transpositions to become the corresponding cycle in $\tau$. If it has an odd length $k$, it will require $k-1$ transpositions as well.
   
   - Therefore, the total number of transpositions needed to transform $\sigma$ into $\tau$ is the sum of $k-1$ for each cycle, which is uniquely determined by the lengths of the cycles. This sum is either even or odd, depending on the parity of the lengths of the cycles.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the parity of the number of transpositions required to transform $\sigma$ into $\tau$ depends solely on the parity of the lengths of the cycles in their cycle decompositions, it is uniquely determined. If the sum of $k-1$ for all cycles is even, both $\sigma$ and $\tau$ have the same parity. If it is odd, they have opposite parity.

This proves that the parity of the number of transpositions required to transform a fixed permutation into another fixed permutation is unique. It relies on the concept that the parity is determined by the lengths of the cycles in their cycle decompositions, and these lengths are fixed for a given permutation.
# **Alternating Groups**

In the realm of abstract algebra and group theory, alternating groups, denoted as $A_n$, are a crucial concept. They are a type of subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$, and they have several interesting properties and applications. Let's explore alternating groups and their significance.

**Definition: Alternating Group**

Given a positive integer $n$, the alternating group $A_n$ is defined as the subgroup of even permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. In other words, $A_n$ consists of permutations that can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions.

**Properties and Characteristics:**

1. **Order of Alternating Group:**
   - The order (number of elements) of $A_n$ is half that of $S_n$. In mathematical terms, $|A_n| = \frac{|S_n|}{2}$.
   - For example, if $n = 3$, then $|S_3| = 6$, and $|A_3| = 3$.

2. **Even Permutations:**
   - Elements of $A_n$ are often referred to as even permutations, as they can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions.
   
3. **Odd Permutations:**
   - Complementary to $A_n$, the set of odd permutations in $S_n$ forms a coset of $A_n$.
   - Odd permutations cannot be written as a product of an even number of transpositions.

4. **Simple Group:**
   - $A_n$ is a simple group for $n \geq 5$, which means it has no non-trivial proper normal subgroups. This property is essential in certain areas of group theory and Galois theory.

**Significance and Applications:**

1. **Parity and Permutations:**
   - Alternating groups are intimately related to the concept of parity in permutations. They are used to distinguish between even and odd permutations based on the number of transpositions required to represent them.
   
2. **Galois Theory:**
   - Alternating groups play a significant role in Galois theory, particularly in the context of solvability by radicals. The solvability of polynomial equations by radicals is related to the solvability of certain groups, and alternating groups are key players in this theory.

3. **Permutation Puzzles:**
   - In recreational mathematics, alternating groups are employed to analyze and solve permutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube and various permutation parity problems.

4. **Group Theory and Abstract Algebra:**
   - Alternating groups are fundamental examples of groups in abstract algebra. They provide insights into group structure and the importance of subgroups.

In summary, alternating groups $A_n$ are subgroups of the symmetric group $S_n$ consisting of even permutations. They are notable for their role in distinguishing between even and odd permutations, their simplicity for $n \geq 5$, and their significance in various areas of mathematics, including Galois theory and permutation puzzles. Understanding alternating groups is crucial in group theory and algebraic studies.

# Square Theorem for Alternating Groups
Let us consider the alternating group $A_n$ and the symmetric group $S_n$ for $n < 5$. We aim to establish that every element of $A_n$ is a square in $S_n$. That is, for each $\alpha \in A_n$, there exists some $\beta \in S_n$ such that $\alpha = \beta^2$. 

Recall that $A_n$ is defined as the set of all even permutations in $S_n$. A permutation is even if it can be represented as a product of an even number of transpositions. Every permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ can be expressed as $\sigma = \tau_1\tau_2\ldots\tau_k$, where each $\tau_i$ is a transposition, and the parity of $\sigma$ is determined by the parity of $k$. 

Now, consider the squaring operation within $S_n$. For any permutation $\beta \in S_n$, $\beta^2 = \beta \beta$. If $\beta$ is represented as a product of transpositions $\beta = \tau_1\tau_2\ldots\tau_m$, then $\beta^2 = \tau_1\tau_2\ldots\tau_m\tau_1\tau_2\ldots\tau_m$. As each transposition is its own inverse, $\tau_i^2$ is the identity for all $i$. Therefore, $\beta^2$ is represented by $2m$ transpositions, which makes $\beta^2$ an even permutation, and thus $\beta^2 \in A_n$.

For $n = 2$, $A_2$ is trivial and only contains the identity permutation, which is its own square.

For $n = 3$, $A_3$ consists of the identity and the two 3-cycles $(123)$ and $(132)$. Each 3-cycle is the square of a 2-cycle in $S_3$, for instance, $(123) = (12)(12)$ and $(132) = (13)(13)$.

For $n = 4$, $A_4$ includes permutations that are products of disjoint 2-cycles and 4-cycles. A 4-cycle can be expressed as a square of two 2-cycles. For example, the 4-cycle $(1234)$ can be expressed as $(12)(34)(12)(34)$. Similarly, a product of disjoint 2-cycles like $(12)(34)$ is the square of the permutation $(13)(24)$. 

Thus, for $n < 5$, every element of $A_n$ is a square in $S_n$. This proposition does not hold for $n \geq 5$, as there are elements in $A_n$ that cannot be expressed as squares in $S_n$, such as the 5-cycle $(12345)$ in $A_5$. 

The argument hinges on the fact that the square of any permutation in $S_n$ results in an even permutation due to the duplication of its transpositions, thereby ensuring that the resulting permutation belongs to $A_n$. Hence, for $n < 5$, the elements of $A_n$ are exactly the squares of elements in $S_n$.

# Symmetric Groups and Platonic Polytopes
### Platonic Polytopes:
Platonic polytopes are regular, convex polytopes in three-dimensional space. There are five Platonic polytopes, namely the tetrahedron, hexahedron (cube), octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.

**Theorem 2 (Platonic Solids Theorem):** There are exactly five convex, regular polyhedra, which are the Platonic polytopes.

Each of these Platonic polytopes has a unique symmetry group associated with it. These symmetry groups are isomorphic to certain subgroups of the Symmetric group.

### Symmetry Groups of Platonic Polytopes:
Let's consider the symmetry groups of Platonic polytopes and their connections to the Symmetric group.

1. **Tetrahedron:** The symmetry group of a tetrahedron is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$ because there are four vertices, and its symmetries correspond to permutations of these vertices.

2. **Hexahedron (Cube):** The symmetry group of a cube is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$. It may seem surprising that it's the same as the tetrahedron, but this is due to the cube having additional rotational symmetries.

3. **Octahedron:** The symmetry group of an octahedron is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$ as well. It shares the same symmetry group as the cube because their structures are dual to each other.

4. **Dodecahedron:** The symmetry group of a dodecahedron is isomorphic to the alternating group $A_5$, which is a subgroup of $S_5$. This connection arises from the icosahedron-dodecahedron duality.

5. **Icosahedron:** The symmetry group of an icosahedron is also isomorphic to the alternating group $A_5$. This, too, comes from the duality between the icosahedron and the dodecahedron.
