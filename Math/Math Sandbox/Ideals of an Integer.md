In algebra and number theory, the concept of an "ideal" is primarily associated with rings, not individual integers. However, we can relate the idea of an ideal to integers when we consider them within the context of ring theory, particularly the ring of integers, \( \mathbb{Z} \).

### Ideal in Ring Theory

An ideal in ring theory is a subset of a ring that has certain properties which make it a generalization of the notion of even numbers in the ring of integers. Specifically, an ideal \( I \) in a ring \( R \) is a subset of \( R \) that satisfies two main conditions:

1. **Closed Under Ring Addition**: For any two elements \( a, b \in I \), their sum \( a + b \) is also in \( I \).

2. **Closed Under Multiplication by Ring Elements**: For any element \( a \in I \) and any ring element \( r \in R \), the product \( ra \) is in \( I \).

### Ideal of an Integer

When considering the ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \), the ideal generated by an integer \( n \) is the set of all multiples of \( n \). This is denoted by \( (n) \) and defined as:

$$
(n) = \{ kn \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$

This set includes all integers that can be written as \( n \) times some other integer. For example:

- The ideal generated by 2, denoted as \( (2) \), includes all even numbers since every even number is a multiple of 2.
- Similarly, the ideal generated by 3, \( (3) \), includes all numbers like 3, 6, 9, -3, -6, etc.

### Properties

- The ideal \( (n) \) in \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an example of a principal ideal since it is generated by a single element.
- In the ring of integers, every ideal is principal, a property that characterizes principal ideal domains (PIDs).
- These ideals respect the two defining properties of ideals: they are closed under addition and under multiplication by any integer.

### Context in Number Theory

Understanding ideals, particularly in the context of the ring of integers, is fundamental in advanced number theory. It leads to deeper concepts like prime ideals, maximal ideals, factor rings, and has implications in algebraic number theory and the study of algebraic structures more broadly.
