An elliptic curve is a specific type of algebraic curve that is defined by a certain equation in the form of a cubic equation in two variables, typically denoted as \(E\). An elliptic curve can be defined over different fields, but we'll focus on elliptic curves defined over the field of complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) or over the field of real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\). The equation for an elliptic curve over \(\mathbb{C}\) typically takes the form:
$$
\[E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\]
$$
Here, \(a\) and \(b\) are constants that define the specific elliptic curve. The important properties of an elliptic curve include its group structure, which allows you to define addition of points on the curve.

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of an elliptic curve is a numeric value that can be calculated from the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) of the elliptic curve's defining equation. It is a crucial invariant associated with the curve and can be used to distinguish different elliptic curves. The discriminant is calculated as:
$$
\[\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)\]
$$
The discriminant serves several purposes:

1. **Classification:** The discriminant can help classify elliptic curves into different categories based on its value. Specifically, it distinguishes between elliptic curves with different shapes and properties.

2. **Singular vs. Non-Singular:** An elliptic curve is non-singular (smooth) if and only if its discriminant is nonzero. Non-singular curves have no singular points, and their geometry is well-behaved. [[Singularity]]

3. **Complex Multiplication:** In the study of elliptic curves over number fields (such as rational numbers), the discriminant is important for understanding complex multiplication, a phenomenon that occurs when an elliptic curve has "extra" endomorphisms beyond the usual scalar multiplication.

4. **Modularity Theorem:** In the context of number theory and the Langlands program, the discriminant plays a role in the Modularity Theorem, a deep result connecting elliptic curves and modular forms.

In summary, an elliptic curve is a specific type of algebraic curve defined by a cubic equation, and its discriminant is a numeric value associated with the curve, calculated from the coefficients of its equation. The discriminant is a crucial invariant for understanding and classifying elliptic curves and plays a significant role in number theory and algebraic geometry.
