- How do we know about numbers?
	- Numbers can't give us causal interactions?
	- Platonism: The world of forms, that we've just imagined them
	- Number's aren't just a human made tool
	- "Potential" for us to start counting
	- Mathematics maybe just about the equations and axioms: It's probably just symbolism: Intuitionism, and Constructivism. 
	- If "it" could possibly exist, it does exist. 
	- We can define things into existence, based on logical self consistency: Formalism
