A coset is a fundamental concept in group theory, a branch of abstract algebra. It arises in the context of group actions and factor groups (also known as quotient groups). To understand cosets, let's break down the key components: cosets and coset representatives.

**Coset:**
A coset is a subset of a group that is obtained by multiplying every element of a subgroup by a fixed element from the original group. Formally, if G is a group, H is a subgroup of G, and 'a' is an element of G, then the left coset of H with respect to 'a' is denoted as 'aH' and defined as:

$$
aH = \{ah : h \in H\}
$$

Here, 'ah' represents the product of 'a' and every element 'h' in the subgroup H. Similarly, the right coset of H with respect to 'a' is denoted as 'Ha' and defined as:

$$
Ha = \{ha : h \in H\}
$$

It's important to note that cosets are not necessarily subgroups themselves; they are often disjoint from each other, and their union covers the entire group.

**Coset Representatives:**
Coset representatives are specific elements chosen from each coset to represent that coset uniquely. The choice of representatives is not unique, and different choices can lead to different representations of cosets. However, coset representatives are usually chosen in a way that simplifies group operations and analysis.

For example, in the context of the integers (Z) under addition, consider the subgroup H = {2Z}, consisting of all even integers. If we choose the coset representative '0,' then the left coset of H with respect to '0' is:

$$
0 + 2Z = \{0 + 2k : k \in Z\} = 2Z
$$

Similarly, the left coset of H with respect to '1' is:

$$
1 + 2Z = \{1 + 2k : k \in Z\} = \{1, 3, 5, ...\}
$$

In this case, '0' and '1' are coset representatives for the two distinct left cosets of H in Z.

Coset representatives play a crucial role in group theory, especially when dealing with factor groups (quotient groups), where cosets become the building blocks for constructing the factor group elements. They help simplify the study of group structures and relations.
