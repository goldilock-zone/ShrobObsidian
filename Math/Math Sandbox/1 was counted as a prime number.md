The phenomenon of some mathematicians in the 19th century considering 1 as a prime number can be attributed to historical developments in the understanding of prime numbers and a lack of a standardized definition for primes during that time. Several factors contributed to this confusion:

1. Historical Perspective: In the earlier history of mathematics, the definition of prime numbers was not as rigorously established as it is today. Mathematicians had varying criteria for what constituted a prime number, and there was no universally accepted definition.

2. Lack of Formalized Definitions: The concept of prime numbers evolved over time, and there wasn't a precise and standardized definition that everyone adhered to. While modern mathematics defines prime numbers as positive integers greater than 1 that have exactly two distinct positive divisors (1 and themselves), this definition wasn't universally adopted in the 19th century.

3. Changing Perspectives: Some mathematicians in the 19th century may have been influenced by older definitions and practices that considered 1 as a prime number. In some historical mathematical texts and traditions, 1 was occasionally included among prime numbers.

4. Emerging Rigor: During the 19th century, mathematics was becoming more formalized and rigorous. Mathematicians were working to establish more precise definitions and axioms to underpin their theories. As part of this process, the modern definition of prime numbers excluding 1 was solidified.

5. Clarification of Definitions: As mathematical rigor improved and definitions became more standardized, the inclusion of 1 as a prime number gradually faded away. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the consensus among mathematicians had shifted to the modern definition of prime numbers, excluding 1.

In summary, the phenomenon of some 19th-century mathematicians considering 1 as a prime number can be attributed to the historical evolution of mathematical concepts and definitions. As mathematics progressed and became more rigorously defined, the inclusion of 1 as a prime number became less common and eventually gave way to the modern definition of primes that we use today, which excludes 1.
