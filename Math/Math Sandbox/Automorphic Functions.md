Automorphic functions, also known as automorphic forms or automorphic representations, are a generalization of modular forms and play a central role in various branches of mathematics, including number theory, representation theory, and harmonic analysis. They are complex-valued functions defined on certain groups that satisfy specific transformation properties.

Here are some key concepts related to automorphic functions:

1. Automorphic Forms: An automorphic form is a complex-valued function defined on a locally compact group G (typically a Lie group) that satisfies certain transformation properties under the action of a discrete subgroup Γ of G. These transformation properties ensure that the function is invariant or equivariant with respect to the action of Γ. Automorphic forms generalize modular forms, which are a special case of automorphic forms associated with the modular group or its congruence subgroups.

2. Modular Forms as Automorphic Forms: Modular forms are a specific class of automorphic forms associated with the modular group SL(2, Z) or its congruence subgroups. They are automorphic forms with specific transformation properties under the action of SL(2, Z). The theory of modular forms is a fundamental part of the theory of automorphic forms.

3. Discrete Subgroups: The discrete subgroup Γ mentioned earlier is often called a congruence subgroup. These are subgroups of the full group G that preserve certain arithmetic properties. For example, in the case of modular forms, Γ is a congruence subgroup of SL(2, Z). The choice of Γ determines the particular automorphic forms and their properties.

4. Transformation Properties: Automorphic forms are required to satisfy specific transformation properties under the action of the group G and its subgroup Γ. These transformation properties are often described using the concept of a character, which assigns a complex number to each element of the group G or its subgroup Γ. Automorphic forms are required to be equivariant with respect to these characters.

5. L-Functions: Automorphic forms are closely related to L-functions, which are complex functions associated with them. L-functions encode deep number-theoretical information, such as the distribution of prime numbers and the properties of number fields. The theory of automorphic forms and their associated L-functions is a central topic in modern number theory.

6. Langlands Program: The Langlands program is a major research program in mathematics that seeks to establish deep connections between automorphic forms, Galois representations, and other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and representation theory. It has profound implications for understanding the connections between number theory and other branches of mathematics.

Automorphic functions and their associated concepts are at the heart of many important results and conjectures in mathematics, including the proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture (resulting in Fermat's Last Theorem) and the Sato-Tate conjecture, among others. They continue to be an active area of research with profound implications for our understanding of number theory and related fields.
