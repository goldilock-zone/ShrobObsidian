Eisenstein series are a class of functions in the theory of modular forms, playing a crucial role in number theory and related fields. Named after the mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein, these series are examples of modular forms and are important for their rich arithmetic and analytical properties.

### Definition

For a given positive even integer \( k \), the Eisenstein series \( G_k \) of weight \( k \) is defined on the upper half-plane \( \mathcal{H} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \text{Im}(z) > 0 \} \) as:
$$
G_k(z) = \sum_{(m,n) \neq (0,0)} \frac{1}{(mz + n)^k}
$$
where the sum is over all pairs of integers \( (m, n) \), excluding \( (0, 0) \). This series converges absolutely for \( k > 2 \).

### Properties

1. **Modularity**: For \( k > 2 \), the Eisenstein series \( G_k \) is a modular form of weight \( k \) for the full modular group \( \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \). This means it satisfies certain transformation properties under the action of this group and is holomorphic on \( \mathcal{H} \) and at the cusp at infinity.

2. **Fourier Expansion**: The Eisenstein series has a Fourier expansion, which reveals its periodicity and the structure of its coefficients, often linked to interesting number-theoretic properties. For example, the Fourier expansion of \( G_k \) involves the Riemann zeta function and Bernoulli numbers.

3. **Special Values**: The values of Eisenstein series at special points in the upper half-plane (like \( i \) or \( e^{2\pi i/3} \)) are related to important constants in mathematics, such as \( \pi \) and values of the gamma function.

### Example: Eisenstein Series of Weight 4

An illustrative example is the Eisenstein series of weight 4:
$$
G_4(z) = \sum_{(m,n) \neq (0,0)} \frac{1}{(mz + n)^4}
$$
This series is a modular form of weight 4 and plays a role in the theory of elliptic functions and the construction of the modular invariant \( j \)-function.

### Significance

Eisenstein series are significant in various branches of mathematics:

- In number theory, they provide a way to construct modular forms, which have applications in problems related to partitions, Diophantine equations, and the distribution of prime numbers.
- In the Langlands program, they appear in the context of automorphic representations and L-functions.
- In algebraic geometry and complex analysis, they offer insights into the geometry of modular curves and the theory of elliptic functions.

The study of Eisenstein series thus bridges multiple areas of mathematics, offering a window into the deep and intricate relationships between seemingly disparate mathematical concepts.
