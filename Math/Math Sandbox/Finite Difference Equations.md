A finite difference equation is an equation that relates the differences between successive values of a sequence. In mathematics, particularly in numerical analysis, finite difference equations are used to approximate derivatives and solve differential equations. They play a crucial role in numerical methods for solving a wide range of problems.

### Definition
Consider a sequence \( \{u_n\} \) indexed by \( n \), where \( n \) typically represents a discrete time or spatial step. A finite difference equation takes the form:
$$
F(u_{n}, u_{n+1}, u_{n+2}, \ldots, u_{n+k}; n) = 0,
$$
where \( F \) is a function that relates various terms of the sequence. The number \( k \) determines the 'order' of the difference equation, which is indicative of how many steps ahead of \( n \) the equation considers.

### Types of Finite Difference Equations
1. **Linear vs. Nonlinear**: If \( F \) is a linear function of the \( u_{n+i} \) terms, then the equation is a linear finite difference equation. Otherwise, it's nonlinear.

2. **Homogeneous vs. Nonhomogeneous**: A homogeneous finite difference equation means that the function \( F \) is equal to zero when all \( u_{n+i} \) terms are zero. If this is not the case, then the equation is nonhomogeneous.

### Applications
Finite difference equations are used in various applications such as:
- **Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations**: They are used to convert continuous differential equations into discrete forms which can be solved using numerical methods.
- **Modeling Temporal or Spatial Processes**: In fields like physics, engineering, and finance, finite difference equations model processes that evolve over time or space.

### Example: The Heat Equation
As an example, consider the one-dimensional heat equation, a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The finite difference method can be used to approximate this PDE. If \( u(x,t) \) represents the temperature at position \( x \) and time \( t \), the PDE is:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
$$
where \( \alpha \) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material.

Using finite differences, we approximate the derivatives by:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \approx \frac{u(x, t+\Delta t) - u(x, t)}{\Delta t},
$$
and
$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x+\Delta x, t) - 2u(x, t) + u(x-\Delta x, t)}{(\Delta x)^2}.
$$
By substituting these approximations into the PDE, we obtain a finite difference equation that can be solved iteratively.

### Conclusion
Finite difference equations are a fundamental tool in numerical analysis, enabling the solution of complex problems in science and engineering by discretizing continuous processes into manageable, computable steps.
