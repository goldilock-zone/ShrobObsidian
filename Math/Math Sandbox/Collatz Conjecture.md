The \(3n + 1\) problem, also known as the Collatz conjecture, is a famous example of a discrete dynamical system. It's deceptively simple to state but has proven to be incredibly difficult to solve. The conjecture revolves around the behavior of sequences generated by a specific recursive process.

### The Collatz Conjecture

#### Definition:

- Start with any positive integer \( n \).
- If \( n \) is even, the next term in the sequence is \( n / 2 \).
- If \( n \) is odd, the next term is \( 3n + 1 \).
- Continue this process iteratively.

#### The Conjecture:

The Collatz conjecture states that no matter what value of \( n \) you start with, the sequence will always eventually reach 1.

### Example Sequence

Let's take an example with \( n = 6 \):

1. Start with 6 (even), so next term is \( 6/2 = 3 \).
2. Now we have 3 (odd), so next term is \( 3 \times 3 + 1 = 10 \).
3. 10 (even) goes to \( 10/2 = 5 \).
4. 5 (odd) goes to \( 3 \times 5 + 1 = 16 \).
5. 16 (even) goes to \( 16/2 = 8 \).
6. 8 (even) goes to \( 8/2 = 4 \).
7. 4 (even) goes to \( 4/2 = 2 \).
8. 2 (even) goes to \( 2/2 = 1 \).

So, the sequence starting at 6 is: \( 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 \).

### Properties and Challenges

1. **Termination:** The conjecture asserts that this sequence will reach the number 1 regardless of which positive integer \( n \) is chosen to start the sequence.

2. **Cycles:** The only known cycle is \( 4, 2, 1 \), but the conjecture is that no other cycles exist.

3. **Unproven:** Despite its simplicity, the Collatz conjecture has neither been proved nor disproved.

4. **Computational Verifications:** The conjecture has been checked for a very large number of starting values of \( n \) with all trials confirming the conjecture, but this is not a proof that it holds for all \( n \).

### Conclusion

The \(3n + 1\) problem is a classic example of a seemingly simple mathematical problem that hides a deep and possibly intractable complexity. It illustrates the intriguing behavior that can arise in discrete dynamical systems and underscores the challenges inherent in understanding even basic iterative processes.
