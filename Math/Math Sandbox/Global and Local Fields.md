In mathematics, the terms "global field" and "local field" refer to different types of fields in the context of number theory and algebraic geometry. These terms are related to the study of algebraic number fields and their completions. Here are the main differences between global fields and local fields:-
1. Global Field:
	   - A global field is a field that is finite-dimensional over its prime field, which is usually either the field of rational numbers (Q) or a finite field (F_q, where q is a prime power).
	   - Examples of global fields include the field of rational numbers (Q), number fields (finite extensions of Q), and function fields over finite fields.
	   - Global fields have a rich arithmetic structure and are often used to study questions related to algebraic number theory, such as the distribution of prime numbers and properties of algebraic number rings.
	
2. Local Field:
	   - A local field is a field that is locally compact with respect to its topology and complete with respect to a nontrivial absolute value (or norm) on the field.
	   - Examples of local fields include the field of p-adic numbers (Q_p), the field of real numbers (R), and the field of complex numbers (C).
	   - Local fields are primarily used to study local aspects of number theory and arithmetic geometry. They are particularly important in the study of p-adic numbers and their applications in algebraic number theory and representation theory.
	In summary, the main difference between global fields and local fields lies in their scope and focus. Global fields are finite-dimensional fields that are often used to study global properties of number fields and function fields, while local fields are fields with specific topological and completeness properties that are used to study local aspects of number theory and related areas.
