 - # Representations of a group using matrix multiplications:
	 - Representations of a group by matrix transformations involve associating each group element with a matrix in such a way that the group's multiplication operation is preserved. Let's delve into this concept:
	
	**Definition**: Consider a group G with elements {g₁, g₂, ..., gₙ}. A representation of G by matrix transformations is a mapping that assigns to each group element gᵢ a square matrix M(gᵢ) of a fixed size such that:
	
	1. **Identity**: M(e) = I, where 'e' is the identity element of the group, and I is the identity matrix of the same size as M(gᵢ).
	
	2. **Closure**: For any two group elements gᵢ and gⱼ, M(gᵢ) * M(gⱼ) = M(gᵢ * gⱼ), where '*' represents the group operation.
	
	3. **Inverse**: For each group element gᵢ, M(gᵢ) has an inverse matrix M(gᵢ)⁻¹ such that M(gᵢ) * M(gᵢ)⁻¹ = I.
	
	These conditions ensure that the matrix representations preserve the group structure, allowing us to perform group operations using matrix multiplication.
	
	**Example**: Let's consider the special orthogonal group SO(2) which consists of 2x2 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. This group is generated by the rotation matrix:
	
	$$
	R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
	    \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
	    \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$
	
	This matrix represents a rotation of an angle θ in the plane. We can define a matrix representation for SO(2) by associating each rotation angle θ with the corresponding matrix R(θ). 
	
	**Theorem**: This matrix representation of SO(2) is a valid group representation, as it satisfies the conditions of a representation mentioned above.
	
	**Proof**:
	1. Identity: When θ = 0, we have R(0) = I, which satisfies the identity condition.
	
	2. Closure: For any two angles θ₁ and θ₂, R(θ₁) * R(θ₂) = R(θ₁ + θ₂), which is the composition of rotations and hence satisfies closure.
	
	3. Inverse: The inverse of R(θ) is R(-θ), and R(θ) * R(-θ) = I, which satisfies the inverse condition.
	
	Thus, the mapping of angles to rotation matrices constitutes a valid representation of SO(2) by matrix transformations.
	
	**Corollary**: Any group that can be represented by matrices in this manner is known as a matrix group.
	
	This representation is a fundamental concept in group theory, and it plays a crucial role in various mathematical and physical applications, such as quantum mechanics and crystallography, where groups of symmetry operations are often represented using matrix transformations.

# Elliptic Curves and Group rule for P+Q
**Group Rule for P+Q**

The "Group Rule for P+Q" is a fundamental property in the context of elliptic curve groups, specifically when adding two points on an elliptic curve. It is an essential operation in elliptic curve cryptography and has intriguing mathematical properties.

**Elliptic Curves:**

First, let's establish some background. An elliptic curve is a specific type of algebraic curve defined by an equation of the form:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$

Here, $a$ and $b$ are constants, and we typically work over a field (such as the real numbers or a finite field). The set of points that satisfy this equation, along with a point at infinity denoted as $\mathcal{O}$, form an elliptic curve group denoted as $E(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the field over which the curve is defined.

**Addition of Points on an Elliptic Curve:**

In elliptic curve cryptography, one of the primary operations is the addition of two points on the curve, denoted as $P$ and $Q$. The result of this addition is another point on the curve, often denoted as $R = P + Q$.

**Group Rule for P+Q:**

The "Group Rule for P+Q" is a rule that defines how to add two points $P$ and $Q$ on an elliptic curve to obtain the resulting point $R = P + Q$. It can be stated as follows:

1. If $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points on the elliptic curve, and the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ intersects the curve at a third point $R$, then the sum of $P$ and $Q$ is defined as the reflection of $R$ with respect to the x-axis. This reflected point is denoted as $R' = P + Q$.

2. If $P$ and $Q$ are the same point (i.e., $P = Q$), and the tangent line at that point intersects the curve at a point $R$, then the sum of $P$ and $Q$ is again defined as the reflection of $R$ with respect to the x-axis. This reflected point is denoted as $R' = P + P$.

It's important to note that the point at infinity $\mathcal{O}$ serves as the identity element in the elliptic curve group, meaning that for any point $P$, we have $P + \mathcal{O} = P$.

# Quantum Piano Strings

1. **Harmonic Vibrations**: On the left, there are diagrams of a string at three different harmonic frequencies labeled C1, C2, and G2. These represent the fundamental mode and the first two overtones of a vibrating string fixed at both ends, such as a piano string. The fundamental frequency (C1) has a single antinode, the first overtone (C2) has two, and the second overtone (G2) has three.

2. **Energy Levels in Quantum Mechanics**: On the right, there are expressions for energy levels labeled $\( E_1, E_2, E_3 \)$. These formulas are reminiscent of the energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator, where $\( n_1, n_2, n_3, ... \)$ are quantum numbers, $\( \hbar \)$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\( \omega \)$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator. The quantum harmonic oscillator has energy levels that are quantized and each level is given by the formula:
   $$
   E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega
   $$
   where \( n = 0, 1, 2, ... \). The $\( \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega \)$ term represents the zero-point energy, the minimum energy that the oscillator possesses.

3. **Total Energy**: At the bottom, there is an equation for total energy $\( E_{total} \)$:
   $$
   E_{total} = (n_1 \times 1 + n_2 \times 2 + n_3 \times 3 + ...)\hbar\omega + E_{z.p.e.}
   $$
   This seems to be summing up the energy contributions from multiple quantum oscillators (perhaps representing multiple modes of vibration in a piano string) where each $\( n_i \)$ could represent the number of quanta in the $\( i \)-th$ mode of vibration, and $\( E_{z.p.e.} \)$ stands for the total zero-point energy of all modes.

The analogy being drawn here is likely between the quantized nature of vibrations in a macroscopic object (like a piano string, where only certain standing wave patterns are allowed) and the quantized energy levels in quantum systems (like the quantum harmonic oscillator).

The mathematics behind the quantum harmonic oscillator is rooted in solving the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a quadratic potential well. The wavefunctions (eigenfunctions) of the Schrödinger equation in this case are [[Hermite polynomials]] multiplied by a Gaussian function, and the corresponding eigenvalues give the quantized energy levels as shown on the slide.

In a physical context, this model is applied to systems like molecular vibrations, phonons in solids, and, in quantum field theory, to the quantization of fields corresponding to elementary particles. The piano string analogy is a way to conceptually bridge the gap between classical physics and quantum mechanics.
