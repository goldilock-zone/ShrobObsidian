Certainly! Here is the list of the 23 problems presented by David Hilbert in his famous 1900 address to the International Congress of Mathematicians:

1. The Continuum Hypothesis: Determine the truth or falsity of the statement that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.

2. The Consistency of Arithmetic: Prove the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic (the Peano axioms) by means of finitistic methods.

3. The Axiomatization of Physics: Provide a complete set of axioms for all physical theories, including mechanics and electromagnetism.

4. The Classification of Quadratic Forms: Develop a general theory for the classification of quadratic forms and the representation of numbers by such forms.

5. The Solvability of Diophantine Equations: Determine the solvability of Diophantine equations (equations with integer coefficients and integer solutions) and develop a general decision procedure for such equations.

6. The Reciprocity Laws: Investigate the reciprocity laws in number theory and their connections with the theory of modular functions.

7. The Quadratic Reciprocity Law: Prove the law of quadratic reciprocity and generalize it to higher power residues.

8. The Riemann Hypothesis: Prove the Riemann Hypothesis concerning the distribution of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

9. The Class Number of Imaginary Quadratic Fields: Determine the class number of imaginary quadratic fields and develop a theory of these fields.

10. The Transcendence of Certain Numbers: Prove the transcendence of specific numbers, such as Euler's constant (γ) and π.

11. The Determination of Irrational Numbers: Investigate the irrationality of specific numbers, including various constants.

12. The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem: Prove Fermat's Last Theorem, which remained unsolved until Andrew Wiles' proof in the 1990s.

13. Invariant Theory: Develop a general theory of invariants for algebraic groups.

14. The Classification of Space Forms: Classify all possible space forms (geometric shapes of constant curvature).

15. The Geometric Investigations of Topological Character: Study topological properties of spaces and their connections with geometric properties.

16. The Foundations of Geometry: Explore the logical foundations of geometry and provide a complete set of axioms for it.

17. The Theory of Algebraic Number Fields: Develop a comprehensive theory of algebraic number fields.

18. The Theory of Integrals and Differential Equations: Extend the theory of functions of real variables, including integrals and differential equations.

19. The Development of the Calculus of Variations: Investigate the calculus of variations and its applications.

20. The Number of Prime Numbers: Determine the distribution and properties of prime numbers, especially in relation to the Riemann zeta function.

21. The Proof of the Existence of Abelian Functions: Establish the existence of Abelian functions and develop a theory of them.

22. The Problem of the Topology of Algebraic Curves and Surfaces: Study the topology of algebraic curves and surfaces and understand their invariants.

23. The Theory of Linear Differential Equations: Extend the theory of linear differential equations.

These problems represent some of the most significant and influential questions in mathematics at the time, and they continue to inspire research and mathematical exploration to this day.
