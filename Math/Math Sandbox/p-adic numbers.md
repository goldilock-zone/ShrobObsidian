To illustrate how a regular number can be represented as a \( p \)-adic number, let's consider the \( p \)-adic number system for a specific prime \( p \). The \( p \)-adic numbers, denoted as 
$$\mathbb{Q}_p $$, are an extension of the rational numbers where the notion of distance is redefined in terms of divisibility by the prime \( p \).

Let's take a simple example with \( p = 5 \) and represent the integer \( 27 \) as a \( 5 \)-adic number. In \( 5 \)-adic numbers, each number is represented as a series of the form:
$$
a_0 + a_1 \cdot 5 + a_2 \cdot 5^2 + a_3 \cdot 5^3 + \ldots
$$
where \( 0 \leq a_i < 5 \) for each \( i \). This series can be finite or infinite, and it converges in the \( 5 \)-adic metric.

To convert \( 27 \) into a \( 5 \)-adic number, we express it in base 5:
$$
27 = 2 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5^1 + 2 \cdot 5^0
$$
So, in \( 5 \)-adic notation, \( 27 \) is represented as \( \ldots 020 \) (read from right to left), where the ellipsis (â€¦) indicates that there are infinitely many zeros to the left. In the \( 5 \)-adic system, this series converges to the number \( 27 \) in the usual sense.

Understanding \( p \)-adic numbers requires a shift in how we normally think about numbers and convergence. In \( p \)-adic analysis, a series converges if the terms eventually become divisible by arbitrarily high powers of \( p \). This is quite different from the usual metric in the real numbers where convergence is about getting arbitrarily close to a fixed number.
