- Just think about the problem
- You will get to stuff that are absolutely useless
- Write a basic skeleton, and try to fill in the gaps
- You can do algebra's on different spaces, and shapes
- Most individual days are failures
- Send it to a journal, and then an initial judgement is made. 
- Then they send it to a an anonymous referee
- Around 2 years, which is very very low, normally

- Lack of maturity: not being able to read a mathematics book
- Book choice is very important
- Algebra, Analysis
- Just stick with it, it's the cost of being independent,
- Look at the table of contents: See if you have a background in the contents
- Wanting to be just familiar with the topics, is okay
- Be patient with yourself

# Tips on Writing Mathematical Papers, John Tsitsiklis
https://youtu.be/NDlBy2O3Eu4
- Efficient Use of your time. It's not useful to get several revisions
- All scales of idea matters (details/ideas). It's almost like fractals
- Document Structure matters
- Good English also matters
- Do not overestimate the readers ability. They must enjoy reading it.
- Be insecure. Just be loud about your results.
- Learn from "good example".
- Cut out random junk
- Make the reader feel happy, even if they don't understand
- Spend time thinking about what we are trying to do.
- Who is the audience of the readership? Have an image of a concrete person
- Collect precise statements of key results
- Typesetting and thinking don't go together
- Make a table with notation
- Stay constant with notation
- Avoid overcomplicated notation: Stuff like double subscript
- Make a conscious decision in the beginning about terminology
- Document Structure: 
	- Abstract
	- Introduction
	- The Model
	- Preliminaries
	- Results
	- Conclusions
	- Appendices
- Ensure that sections are modulars. Also use lots of headings. 
- Define the objectives of a subsection
- Editorializing should not be in an abstract. Do not use boilerplate
- Most people read the introduction. Make sure that this is great.
- Try to make bullet points for each section. 
- Don'ts keep a theme running between paragraphs
- Give a preview of the main results in the Introduction.
- What's new? What're the key contributions
- Be Deliberate. Do not go with the flow.
- Sections consist of modules of different types
- Must be lookup-able.
- Give the idea of a proof, before actually writing the proof. Give the high level picture
- Talk about counterexamples, and give boundary conditions
- Examples of special cases
- Do not shy away from figures
- Make figures a self contained story
- Usually we discover proofs by thinking backwards. 
- Do not be circular. Proofs must be written in a linear way. 
- Do not be convoluted. Stay linear.
- No rabbit's out of the hat. Don't make sudden jumps of intuition. You don't need to impress your audience. 
- Sometimes we might want to send stuff to appendices
- You must be able to read the main text without flipping to the appendices
- Alert the reader when skipping steps
- Don't make the reader feel bad.
