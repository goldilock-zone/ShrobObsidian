Dirichlet's characters are a central concept in number theory, particularly in the study of L-functions and modular forms. They are named after the German mathematician Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. To understand Dirichlet's characters, it's helpful to start with some foundational concepts.

1. **Modular Arithmetic**: This is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value, known as the modulus. For example, in arithmetic modulo $n$, we consider two integers equivalent if their difference is a multiple of $n$.

2. **Group Theory**: A group in mathematics is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element and satisfies four conditions: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. Dirichlet's characters are related to the group of units in modular arithmetic.

A **Dirichlet character** $\chi$ modulo $n$ is a complex-valued function defined on the integers, which satisfies the following properties:

- **Periodicity**: $\chi(a) = \chi(b)$ if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$.
- **Multiplicativity**: $\chi(ab) = \chi(a)\chi(b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$.
- **Non-triviality on Units**: $\chi(a) = 0$ if $\gcd(a, n) > 1$. This means that $\chi(a)$ is non-zero only if $a$ is coprime to $n$.

An important example is the principal character modulo $n$, denoted $\chi_0$, which takes the value $1$ for integers coprime to $n$ and $0$ otherwise.

Dirichlet characters are essential in defining Dirichlet L-functions, which generalize the Riemann zeta function and play a crucial role in analytic number theory, particularly in the proof of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. This theorem states that for any two coprime integers $a$ and $d$, there are infinitely many primes of the form $a + nd$ ($n$ being a non-negative integer), indicating that primes are evenly distributed in arithmetic progressions.
