**Hermite Polynomials**

Hermite polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials defined on the real line. They are denoted by $H_n(x)$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the standard Gaussian weight function $e^{-x^2}$, and they satisfy the following recurrence relation:

$$H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - 2nH_{n-1}(x)$$

with initial conditions $H_0(x) = 1$ and $H_1(x) = 2x$.

Hermite polynomials have numerous applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in the study of quantum mechanics and harmonic oscillators.

**Orthogonality Property:**

The Hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight function $e^{-x^2}$ on the real line, which can be expressed as:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} H_m(x)H_n(x)e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}2^n n!\delta_{mn}$$

where $\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to 1 when $m = n$ and 0 otherwise. This [[orthogonality property (of polynomials)]] is useful in various mathematical and physical applications, such as solving differential equations involving Hermite polynomials.

**Generating Function:**

The generating function of Hermite polynomials is given by:

$$e^{xt - \frac{t^2}{2}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{H_n(x)}{n!}t^n$$

This generating function provides a convenient way to express Hermite polynomials in terms of their coefficients.

**Recurrence Relation and Differential Equation:**

Hermite polynomials also satisfy a second-order differential equation, known as the Hermite differential equation:

$$\frac{d^2H_n(x)}{dx^2} - 2x\frac{dH_n(x)}{dx} + 2nH_n(x) = 0$$

This differential equation is another fundamental property of Hermite polynomials and is used in solving various problems in physics and mathematics.

**Rodrigues' Formula:**

Hermite polynomials can also be expressed using Rodrigues' formula as follows:

$$H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x^2}\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(e^{-x^2})$$

This formula provides an alternative way to compute Hermite polynomials through differentiation.

**Hermite-Gauss Quadrature:**

The orthogonality property of Hermite polynomials is utilized in numerical integration methods known as Hermite-Gauss quadrature. It provides accurate approximations of definite integrals by choosing appropriate nodes and weights based on Hermite polynomials. This quadrature method is particularly efficient for integrating functions with Gaussian weight.

In conclusion, Hermite polynomials are a significant mathematical tool with various applications in mathematical analysis, physics, and engineering. Their orthogonality properties, recurrence relations, and differential equations make them a valuable component of mathematical techniques used in diverse fields.
