The Shimura-Taniyama-Weil Conjecture, now often referred to as the Modularity Theorem, is a deep and fascinating result in number theory, connecting two seemingly unrelated areas: elliptic curves and modular forms. Let's delve into its rigorous details:

1. **Elliptic Curves**:
   An elliptic curve is defined over a field (usually the field of rational numbers, $$ \mathbb{Q} $$) and can be represented by a [[Weierstrass equation]]:

   $$
   y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
   $$

   Here, $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ are coefficients that satisfy a condition ensuring that the curve has no singularities (i.e., no cusps or self-intersections).

2. **Modular Forms**:
   A modular form of weight $$ k $$ for a subgroup $$ \Gamma $$ of $$ SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $$ is a complex analytic function on the upper half-plane that satisfies certain transformation properties under the action of $$ \Gamma $$ and has a Fourier expansion at infinity. These forms are central objects in the theory of complex analysis and number theory.

3. **Statement of the Conjecture/Theorem**:
   The original conjecture, posed independently by Taniyama, Shimura, and Weil, can be stated as follows:

   > Every [[Elliptic curve]] $$ E $$ defined over $$ \mathbb{Q} $$ is modular. This means there exists a modular form $$ f $$ of weight 2 for a congruence subgroup of $$ SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $$, such that the L-series of $$ E $$ coincides with the L-series of $$ f $$.

4. **Significance**:
   - The conjecture links two major objects in number theory: elliptic curves and modular forms.
   - Its proof by Andrew Wiles, partly in collaboration with Richard Taylor, was a landmark achievement, primarily because it led to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.
   - It has deep implications in the understanding of Galois representations and L-functions.

5. **Proof and Developments**:
   - Andrew Wiles, with crucial contributions from Richard Taylor, proved the conjecture for a significant class of elliptic curves in 1994.
   - The full conjecture was proven over subsequent years through the work of several mathematicians, including Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor.

6. **Mathematical Impact**:
   The proof of the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil Conjecture revolutionized modern number theory. It exemplified the power of the Langlands program, which aims to unify different areas of mathematics through the concept of L-functions and automorphic forms.
