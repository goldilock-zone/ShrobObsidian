An automorphic form is a complex-valued function with certain invariance properties under the action of a group. These forms are central objects in modern number theory and play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, representation theory, and the Langlands program. To give an example, I will describe the modular form, a special type of automorphic form, in a relatively accessible way.

**Example: A Modular Form of Weight 2**

Consider the upper half-plane $$\mathcal{H} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \text{Im}(z) > 0\} $$ and the [[Modular group]] $$ \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) $$, consisting of $$2 \times 2 $$matrices with integer entries and determinant 1. A modular form of weight 2 is a holomorphic function $$ f: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} $$ satisfying certain transformation properties under the action of $$\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) $$.

A classic example is the [[Eisenstein series]] of weight 2, defined as:
$$ G_2(z) = \sum_{(m,n) \neq (0,0)} \frac{1}{(mz + n)^2} $$
where the sum is taken over all pairs of integers \( (m, n) \) except \( (0, 0) \).

This series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets of \($$ \mathcal{H} $$\) and satisfies the following transformation property for any \( $$\gamma = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) $$\):
$$ G_2(\gamma z) = (cz + d)^2 G_2(z) + \frac{c(cz+d)}{2\pi i} $$
where \( $$ \gamma z = \frac{az + b}{cz + d} $$\).

This example illustrates how modular forms are functions that are "almost" invariant under the action of the modular group, with the transformation rule incorporating both the function itself and its derivative (in the case of weight 2). Modular forms have deep connections to elliptic curves, L-functions, and the theory of complex multiplication, among other areas. They are a rich source of interesting and important results in number theory and related fields.
