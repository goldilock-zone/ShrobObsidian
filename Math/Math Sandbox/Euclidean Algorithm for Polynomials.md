The concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD) can be extended from integers to polynomials. Just like with integers, the GCD of two polynomials is the highest-degree polynomial that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The process of finding the GCD of polynomials is akin to the Euclidean Algorithm used for integers, but it employs polynomial division instead of integer division.

### Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomials

To find the GCD of two polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \), we can use the Euclidean Algorithm, which iteratively applies polynomial division. Here's a high-level overview of the steps:

1. **Division Step:** Divide \( P(x) \) by \( Q(x) \) to obtain a quotient \( Q_1(x) \) and a remainder \( R_1(x) \), so that:
   $$ P(x) = Q(x) \cdot Q_1(x) + R_1(x) $$
   where the degree of \( R_1(x) \) is less than the degree of \( Q(x) \).

2. **Iterative Step:** Replace \( P(x) \) with \( Q(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) with \( R_1(x) \), and repeat the division process.

3. **Termination:** Continue this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \).

### Properties of Polynomial GCD

- **Degree:** The GCD of two polynomials has a degree that is less than or equal to the degree of both polynomials.
- **Uniqueness:** The GCD is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar (in the field over which the polynomials are defined). It is often normalized to be a monic polynomial (leading coefficient equal to 1) for uniqueness.
- **Field Dependence:** The GCD depends on the field over which the polynomials are defined. For example, the GCD over the real numbers might differ from the GCD over the complex numbers.

### Practical Applications

GCD calculations for polynomials are important in various areas of mathematics and applied sciences, including:

- Simplifying rational functions (by canceling common factors in numerator and denominator).
- Solving polynomial equations in algebraic geometry.
- Analyzing the structure of polynomial rings in abstract algebra.
