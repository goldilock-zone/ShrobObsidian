### Hahn-Banach Theorem (Simplified Version)

**Statement:** 
$$
\text{Let } V \text{ be a vector space over the field } \mathbb{R} \text{ (real numbers) or } \mathbb{C} \text{ (complex numbers), equipped with a sublinear function } p: V \to \mathbb{R}. 
$$
$$
\text{If } f \text{ is a linear functional defined on a subspace } U \subseteq V \text{ such that } f(x) \leq p(x) \text{ for all } x \in U, 
$$
$$
\text{then there exists an extension } \tilde{f} \text{ of } f \text{ to the entire space } V \text{ such that } \tilde{f}(x) \leq p(x) \text{ for all } x \in V.
$$

### Explanation and Significance:

1. **Vector Space and Linear Functionals:**
   - A vector space is a set where vectors can be added and scaled. Linear functionals are mappings from a vector space to its field that are linear.
   - **Mathematically:** For a vector space $$ V $$ and a field $$ F $$, a linear functional is a map $$ f: V \to F $$ that satisfies:
     $$ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) $$ for all $$ x, y \in V $$.
     $$ f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x) $$ for all $$ x \in V $$ and $$ \alpha \in F $$.

2. **Sublinear Function:**
   - A sublinear function $$ p $$ on $$ V $$ is a function that satisfies:
     $$ p(x + y) \leq p(x) + p(y) $$ for all $$ x, y \in V $$.
     $$ p(\alpha x) = \alpha p(x) $$ for all $$ x \in V $$ and all scalars $$ \alpha \geq 0 $$.

3. **Extension of Functionals:**
   - The theorem asserts the ability to extend a linear functional $$ f $$ from a subspace $$ U $$ to the entire space $$ V $$ without violating the condition $$ f(x) \leq p(x) $$.

4. **Applications:**
   - The Hahn-Banach Theorem is pivotal in analysis, aiding in understanding dual spaces, operator theory, and in establishing continuous functionals.

### Technicalities and Versions:

- The theorem has multiple forms, including geometric and analytic, and can be applied in normed spaces and broader contexts.
- Its proof involves Zorn's Lemma, a result in set theory related to the Axiom of Choice.

The Hahn-Banach Theorem is a foundational element in functional analysis, influencing the study of infinite-dimensional spaces and shaping modern mathematical analysis.
