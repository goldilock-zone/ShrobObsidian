A Weierstrass equation is a fundamental concept in the study of elliptic curves, representing these curves in a simple and elegant algebraic form. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Basic Form**:
   A Weierstrass equation typically describes an elliptic curve as a cubic equation in two variables. The most general form over a field \( K \) (often taken as the field of real or complex numbers, or the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \)) is:

   \[
   y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6
   \]

   Here, \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \) and \( a_6 \) are coefficients in \( K \).

2. **Simplified Weierstrass Equation**:
   Over fields not of characteristic 2 or 3 (like \( \mathbb{R} \) or \( \mathbb{Q} \)), it's often simplified to:

   \[
   y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
   \]

   This simplified form is widely used due to its elegance and ease of handling.

3. **Condition for Non-singularity**:
   An essential aspect of the Weierstrass equation for it to represent an elliptic curve is that the curve must be non-singular. This means the curve has no cusps or self-intersections. Mathematically, this is ensured by the condition that the discriminant of the curve is non-zero. For the simplified equation, the discriminant \( \Delta \) is given by:

   \[
   \Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)
   \]

   The curve is non-singular if and only if \( \Delta \neq 0 \).

4. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   Geometrically, an elliptic curve is a smooth, closed curve with a distinct shape characterized by this equation. It has a single "loop" in the real plane and extends infinitely in the complex plane, forming a torus.

5. **Applications**:
   - **Algebraic Geometry**: Weierstrass equations are foundational in studying elliptic curves.
   - **Number Theory**: They play a crucial role in the theory of Diophantine equations, including famous problems like Fermat's Last Theorem.
   - **Cryptography**: Elliptic curves defined by these equations are used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

The Weierstrass equation's power lies in its ability to translate the geometric properties of elliptic curves into an algebraic language, enabling deep mathematical explorations. If you require a LaTeX version of this explanation or have more specific queries, feel free to ask.
