A Galois group is a fundamental concept in abstract algebra and algebraic number theory. It is named after Évariste Galois, a French mathematician who made pioneering contributions to the study of algebra and group theory in the 19th century. The Galois group is associated with the symmetries and solvability of polynomial equations.

Here's a more detailed explanation of what a Galois group is:

1. **Field Extensions**: To understand Galois groups, it's essential to start with the concept of field extensions. In algebra, a field is a mathematical structure that includes the set of numbers and operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. An algebraic field extension occurs when you take one field and "extend" it by adjoining new elements (roots of polynomials) to create a larger field.

2. **Polynomial Equations**: Galois groups are particularly concerned with polynomial equations. Given a polynomial equation with coefficients in a field (usually a rational or algebraic number field), you can study the field extensions that are generated by the roots of that polynomial.

3. **Symmetries of Equations**: The Galois group of a polynomial equation consists of all the permutations (rearrangements) of its roots that preserve the algebraic properties of the field. In other words, it's the group of symmetries of the equation with respect to its roots.

4. **Properties and Significance**: Galois groups provide insights into whether a given polynomial equation can be solved by radicals (i.e., whether it has a closed-form solution involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and nth roots) and whether it has multiple distinct solutions. They are instrumental in determining the solvability of equations using elementary operations.

5. **Galois Theory**: Évariste Galois developed Galois theory, which is the branch of mathematics that studies Galois groups and their properties. The main theorem of Galois theory, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, establishes a correspondence between subgroups of the Galois group and intermediate fields between the base field and its extension. This correspondence provides a powerful tool for understanding field extensions and the solutions to polynomial equations.

Galois groups are not only essential in algebraic number theory but also have applications in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and cryptography. They play a crucial role in understanding the solvability of polynomial equations and the relationships between field extensions, making them a fundamental concept in modern algebra.

# A better explanation, with an example
A Galois group is a fundamental concept in the field of algebra, specifically in the study of field extensions and polynomial equations. It captures the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial and their relationships to each other. To illustrate, let's consider a simple and classic example: the Galois group of a quadratic polynomial over the field of rational numbers.

Consider the quadratic polynomial 
$$ f(x) = x^2 - 2 $$
over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \). The roots of this polynomial are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), which are not in \( \mathbb{Q} \). The smallest field containing \( \mathbb{Q} \) and these roots is \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \), which is a quadratic extension of \( \mathbb{Q} \).

$$
\text{The Galois group of this polynomial, denoted as}  \text{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}) , \text{consists of all [[Automorphisms]] of } \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})  \text{that fix}  \mathbb{Q} \text{elementwise. In this case, there are two such automorphisms:}
$$
1. The identity automorphism, which maps every element to itself.
2. The automorphism that swaps the roots, i.e., it maps \( \sqrt{2} \) to \( -\sqrt{2} \) and vice versa.

These automorphisms form a group under composition. The Galois group of \( f(x) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as \( C_2 \) or \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \). This group reflects the fact that there's a "symmetry" in how the roots of the polynomial relate to each other, and this symmetry can be captured by an operation that effectively "swaps" these roots.

This example demonstrates the fundamental principle behind Galois theory: understanding the symmetries and structure of the roots of polynomials through the lens of group theory. This approach has profound implications in various areas of mathematics, including the solvability of polynomial equations and the structure of field extensions.
