To solve linear congruences, we can use the following approach:

1. **Given Linear Congruence**: Start with a linear congruence in the form:
   $$ax \equiv b \pmod{m}$$
   Where:
   - $a$ is the coefficient of the variable $x$.
   - $b$ is a constant.
   - $m$ is the modulus.

2. **Check for Solvability**: First, check if there is a solution to the congruence. It exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $m$ divides $b$. In mathematical terms:
   $$\text{If } \text{gcd}(a, m) \nmid b, \text{ there is no solution.}$$

3. **Find the Modular Multiplicative Inverse**: If the congruence is solvable, proceed to find the modular multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $m$. The modular multiplicative inverse of $a$ (if it exists) is denoted as $a^{-1}$ and satisfies the equation:
   $$a \cdot a^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$$
   You can find $a^{-1}$ using methods like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

4. **Solve for $x$**: Once you have found $a^{-1}$, you can solve for $x$ by multiplying both sides of the congruence by $a^{-1}$:
   $$x \equiv a^{-1} \cdot b \pmod{m}$$
   This equation gives you the solution for $x$ modulo $m$.

5. **Express the Solution Set**: The solution to the linear congruence is not unique. It forms an equivalence class modulo $m$. Therefore, you can express the solution set as follows:
   $$x \equiv a^{-1} \cdot b + k \cdot m, \text{ where } k \in \mathbb{Z}$$
   This represents all possible solutions for $x$.

6. **Final Solution**: If you need a specific representative of the solution set, you can choose one by setting a suitable value for $k$. Common choices include choosing the smallest non-negative integer or the unique representative in the range $[0, m-1]$.

This approach ensures that you find a solution for the given linear congruence, and it provides a general representation for all possible solutions in terms of modular arithmetic.
