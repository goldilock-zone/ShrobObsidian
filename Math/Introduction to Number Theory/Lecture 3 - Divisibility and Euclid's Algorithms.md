# Notation for Divisibility
In mathematics, the concept of divisibility is articulated using specific notation that succinctly captures the relationship between two integers. When we say that an integer \( a \) is divisible by another integer \( b \), it means that when \( a \) is divided by \( b \), the result is an integer with no remainder. In other words, \( b \) is a divisor of \( a \), or \( a \) is a multiple of \( b \).

The common notation used to express divisibility is:

$$
b \mid a
$$

This is read as "b divides a". Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, and the divisibility implies that there exists an integer \( k \) such that:

$$
a = bk
$$

For example, if we consider \( a = 12 \) and \( b = 3 \), we can say \( 3 \mid 12 \) because \( 12 = 3 \times 4 \), where \( 4 \) is an integer. 

Conversely, if \( b \) does not divide \( a \) (that is, if dividing \( a \) by \( b \) leaves a remainder), we use the notation:

$$
b \nmid a
$$

For instance, since \( 5 \) does not divide \( 12 \) evenly (as \( 12 = 5 \times 2 + 2 \) has a remainder of \( 2 \)), we write \( 5 \nmid 12 \).

# Combinatorics in Divisibility Proofs
The relationship between combinatorics, binomial coefficients, and divisibility is an intriguing aspect of number theory and discrete mathematics. Combinatorics, the study of counting, arrangement, and combination of objects, often utilizes binomial coefficients, which have inherent properties that intersect with concepts of divisibility.

### Binomial Coefficients

The binomial coefficient, denoted as \( \binom{n}{k} \), represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without considering the order of selection. It's defined as:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
$$

where \( n! \) denotes the factorial of \( n \).

### Role in Divisibility Proofs

1. **Divisibility Properties**: Binomial coefficients exhibit specific divisibility properties. For instance, Pascal's triangle, which is constructed using binomial coefficients, reveals patterns that can be analyzed for divisibility by certain numbers.

2. **Applications in Proofs**: In divisibility proofs, one might encounter scenarios where you need to demonstrate that a binomial coefficient is divisible by a number. For example, showing that \( \binom{n}{k} \) is divisible by a prime \( p \) under certain conditions. This often involves manipulating factorials and applying theorems from number theory, such as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic or Euclid's lemma.

3. **Combinatorial Arguments**: Many divisibility proofs, especially those involving integers with specific properties (like being even, odd, or prime), can be framed as combinatorial problems. For instance, proving that a certain combination of objects satisfies a divisibility property might involve counting those combinations using binomial coefficients and analyzing their divisibility.

### Example: Proving Divisibility Using Combinatorics

Consider proving that \( \binom{2n}{n} \) is even for \( n \geq 1 \). This statement can be approached combinatorially:

1. **Combinatorial Interpretation**: \( \binom{2n}{n} \) represents the number of ways to choose \( n \) items from a set of \( 2n \) items.
2. **Divisibility Analysis**: Notice that \( \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} \). Since \( (2n)! \) includes more factors of 2 than either of the \( n! \) in the denominator (due to the presence of terms like \( 2n, 2n-2, \ldots, 2 \)), the fraction must be even.

### Further Implications

- **Lucas' Theorem and Kummer's Theorem**: These theorems provide insights into the divisibility of binomial coefficients by a prime number, linking number theory with combinatorics. [[Lucas' Theorem and Kummer's Theorem]]
- **Generating Functions**: In combinatorics, generating functions often involve binomial coefficients and can be analyzed for their divisibility properties.

In summary, combinatorics and binomial coefficients play a significant role in understanding and proving properties related to divisibility. They offer a framework for constructing and analyzing mathematical arguments in a discrete setting, often revealing deeper connections within number theory.

# Euclid's Division Algorithm
Euclid's Division Algorithm is a classical approach to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. This algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. This fundamental algorithm not only plays a crucial role in number theory but also forms the basis for more complex algorithms in modern computational mathematics.

### Description of Euclid's Division Algorithm

The algorithm proceeds as follows for two integers \( a \) and \( b \):

1. **Ensure \( a \geq b \)**: If \( a < b \), swap the two numbers.

2. **Division Step**: Divide \( a \) by \( b \), expressing \( a \) as \( a = bq + r \), where \( q \) is the quotient and \( r \) is the remainder. Here, \( 0 \leq r < b \).

3. **Iterate or Terminate**:
   - If \( r = 0 \), then \( b \) is the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - If \( r \neq 0 \), replace \( a \) with \( b \) and \( b \) with \( r \), and repeat the division step.

4. **Repeat Until Remainder is Zero**: Continue this process until the remainder becomes zero. The non-zero remainder at the last non-zero step is the GCD of the original pair of numbers.

### Example

Let's demonstrate Euclid's Division Algorithm to find the GCD of \( 48 \) and \( 18 \):

1. **Initial Step**: \( a = 48 \), \( b = 18 \) (already \( a \geq b \)).
2. **First Division**: \( 48 = 18 \times 2 + 12 \) (quotient is 2, remainder is 12).
3. **Update and Repeat**: Now \( a = 18 \) and \( b = 12 \).
4. **Second Division**: \( 18 = 12 \times 1 + 6 \) (quotient is 1, remainder is 6).
5. **Update and Repeat**: Now \( a = 12 \) and \( b = 6 \).
6. **Third Division**: \( 12 = 6 \times 2 + 0 \) (quotient is 2, remainder is 0).
7. **Conclusion**: Since the remainder is now zero, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is \( 6 \).

### Significance

Euclid's Division Algorithm is elegant and efficient, making it a fundamental tool in elementary number theory. It is not only used for finding GCDs but also forms the basis of more complex algorithms, including those in cryptography and computer science. Its simplicity and efficiency make it an essential algorithm in the toolkit of mathematicians and computer scientists alike.

## Note: 
- Euclid represented his algorithm as a line segment, trying to fill up the line with segments of the quotient number
- They didn't even count 0 as a number
- Q and R are unique in the algorithm

# Proof of d|x form an ideal closed under addition and subtraction

To prove that the set of integers divisible by a fixed integer \( d \) forms an ideal in the ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) that is closed under addition and subtraction, we need to show that this set satisfies the defining properties of an ideal. Let's denote this set as \( I_d \), where

$$ I_d = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid d \mid x \}. $$

In other words, \( I_d \) contains all integers that are multiples of \( d \).

### Properties to Prove

1. **Closure under Addition**: For any two elements \( a, b \in I_d \), their sum \( a + b \) must also be in \( I_d \).
2. **Closure under Subtraction**: For any two elements \( a, b \in I_d \), their difference \( a - b \) must also be in \( I_d \).
3. **Closure under Multiplication by Ring Elements**: For any element \( a \in I_d \) and any ring element \( r \in \mathbb{Z} \), the product \( ra \) must be in \( I_d \).

### Proof

1. **Closure under Addition**:
   - Suppose \( a, b \in I_d \). By definition, \( d \) divides \( a \) and \( b \), so there exist integers \( k, l \) such that \( a = dk \) and \( b = dl \).
   - Consider their sum: \( a + b = dk + dl = d(k + l) \).
   - Since \( k + l \) is an integer (integers are closed under addition), \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( d \).
   - Therefore, \( a + b \in I_d \).

2. **Closure under Subtraction**:
   - Again, let \( a, b \in I_d \), with \( a = dk \) and \( b = dl \) for some integers \( k, l \).
   - Consider their difference: \( a - b = dk - dl = d(k - l) \).
   - Since \( k - l \) is an integer (integers are closed under subtraction), \( a - b \) is a multiple of \( d \).
   - Therefore, \( a - b \in I_d \).

3. **Closure under Multiplication by Ring Elements**:
   - Let \( a \in I_d \) and \( r \in \mathbb{Z} \), with \( a = dk \) for some integer \( k \).
   - Consider the product: \( ra = r(dk) = d(rk) \).
   - Since \( rk \) is an integer (integers are closed under multiplication), \( ra \) is a multiple of \( d \).
   - Therefore, \( ra \in I_d \).

### Conclusion

The set \( I_d \) of all integers divisible by \( d \) satisfies the necessary properties to be an ideal in the ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \). It is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication by any element in \( \mathbb{Z} \). Thus, \( I_d \) forms an ideal in \( \mathbb{Z} \).
