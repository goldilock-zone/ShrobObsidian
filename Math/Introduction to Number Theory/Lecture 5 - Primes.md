# Definition of Primes
A prime number is defined within the realm of integers. Formally, an integer $$ p > 1 $$ is said to be a prime number if its only positive divisors are 1 and itself. In other words, if the only solutions to the equation $$ p = ab $$, where $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ are integers, are when either $$ a = p $$ and $$ b = 1 $$, or $$ a = 1 $$ and $$ b = p $$.

This definition excludes 1 from being a prime number, as its only divisor is itself, and it doesn't satisfy the condition of having two distinct positive divisors. Additionally, negative integers and non-integer numbers are not considered when discussing prime numbers, as the concept is inherently tied to the set of positive integers greater than 1.

In a more abstract sense, prime numbers can be seen as the fundamental building blocks of the integers, since any integer greater than 1 can be uniquely factored into a product of prime numbers, a principle known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Sometimes: [[1 was counted as a prime number]]

# Extension of the definitions of primes to negative numbers

Extending the concept of prime numbers to include negative integers requires a bit of nuance, primarily because the original definition of a prime number is intrinsically linked to the set of positive integers. However, in a broader algebraic context, particularly within the domain of ring theory, this extension is indeed possible and meaningful.

In ring theory, an element \( p \) in a ring \( R \) is called a prime element if it satisfies the following two conditions:

1. **Non-Unit and Non-Zero**: \( p \) is neither a unit (an element with a multiplicative inverse) nor zero.
2. **Prime Property**: Whenever \( p \) divides a product \( ab \), with \( a, b \in R \), then \( p \) must divide at least one of \( a \) or \( b \).

Applying this to the ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \), we can consider negative numbers. For instance, in this context, \(-3\) is a prime because:

- It is neither a unit nor zero.
- If \(-3\) divides a product \( ab \), then it must divide either \( a \) or \( b \).

In essence, the negative counterpart of a positive prime number (like \(-2\), \(-3\), \(-5\), etc.) also behaves as a prime in this extended sense. This broadens our perspective on divisibility and factors within the integers.

However, it's important to recognize that this extension is more abstract and is usually discussed within the realms of higher algebra and number theory. In elementary arithmetic and basic number theory, when we talk about prime numbers, we are typically referring to the positive primes as per the traditional definition.
