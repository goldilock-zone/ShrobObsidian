# Diffie and Hellman
Diffie and Hellman introduced the concept of public key cryptography, which relies on the existence of trapdoor functions. A trapdoor function is a one-way function that can be easily computed in one direction but is computationally difficult to invert without specific knowledge, referred to as the "trapdoor" information.

Let's explore the concept of a trapdoor function and its relevance in public key cryptography.

**Trapdoor Function (Definition):**
A trapdoor function, denoted as $f(x)$, is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction (i.e., given $x$, computing $f(x)$ is efficient), but computationally difficult to compute in the reverse direction (i.e., given $f(x)$, finding $x$ is hard), unless you possess certain secret information or keys.

**Example of a Trapdoor Function: RSA Cryptosystem**
One of the most well-known trapdoor functions is used in the RSA cryptosystem, which relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. The RSA encryption and decryption processes are as follows:

1. **Key Generation:**
   - Select two large prime numbers, $p$ and $q$.
   - Compute their product, $n = p \cdot q$.
   - Select an integer $e$ such that $1 < e < \phi(n)$ (where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function) and $e$ is relatively prime to $\phi(n)$.
   - Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of $e$ modulo $\phi(n)$, denoted as $d$, such that $d \cdot e \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$.

   Public key: $(n, e)$
   Private key: $d$

2. **Encryption (Using Public Key):**
   Given a plaintext message $M$, compute the ciphertext $C$ as: $C \equiv M^e \pmod{n}$.

3. **Decryption (Using Private Key):**
   Given the ciphertext $C$, compute the plaintext message $M$ as: $M \equiv C^d \pmod{n}$.

The security of the RSA cryptosystem relies on the difficulty of factoring the product $n$ (which is part of the public key) into its prime factors $p$ and $q$. This factorization problem is computationally hard without knowledge of the prime factors and serves as the trapdoor.

**Relevance in Public Key Cryptography:**
The trapdoor function property is crucial in public key cryptography because it enables secure communication between parties who have never shared secret keys before. The public key can be freely distributed, allowing anyone to encrypt messages, while only the holder of the private key (with the trapdoor information) can efficiently decrypt and recover the original message. This concept revolutionized secure communication over untrusted networks and forms the foundation of many modern cryptographic systems.

In summary, the concept of a trapdoor function, as exemplified by the RSA cryptosystem, plays a fundamental role in public key cryptography. It allows for secure encryption and decryption processes without the need for shared secret keys, making secure communication feasible in open environments.

# Difference betweena  secure hash and trapdoor function

In the realm of cryptography, secure hash functions and trapdoor functions serve distinct purposes and possess different characteristics. Let's delve into the fundamental differences between these two cryptographic primitives.

**Secure Hash Function:**
A secure hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (often called a message) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, known as the hash value or hash code. Secure hash functions have several key properties:

1. **Deterministic:** For a given input, a secure hash function always produces the same hash value.

2. **Fixed Output Length:** Regardless of the input size, a secure hash function produces a hash value of a fixed length.

3. **Efficient to Compute:** It is computationally efficient to compute the hash value for any given input.

4. **Pre-image Resistance:** Given a hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to determine the original input (pre-image) that produced that hash value.

5. **Collision Resistance:** It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value (collision).

Secure hash functions are commonly used for data integrity verification, password hashing, digital signatures, and various other cryptographic applications. They do not involve any secret information or trapdoor, and their primary purpose is to provide data integrity and authenticity.

**Trapdoor Function:**
A trapdoor function, on the other hand, is a mathematical function that possesses the property of being easy to compute in one direction but computationally hard to reverse (invert) without specific knowledge, often referred to as the "trapdoor" information. Key characteristics of trapdoor functions include:

1. **One-Way Function:** Given the function's output, it is computationally difficult to find the original input without the trapdoor information.

2. **Efficient with Trapdoor:** With the trapdoor information, the function can be efficiently inverted.

3. **Public and Private Keys:** Trapdoor functions are typically used in asymmetric cryptography, where there are public and private keys. The trapdoor information is kept secret and forms the basis for private key operations.

Trapdoor functions are central to asymmetric encryption and digital signature schemes, such as RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). They enable secure communication between parties that have never shared secret keys before, as the trapdoor information is kept private.

**Summary of Differences:**

1. **Purpose:** Secure hash functions are primarily used for data integrity and authentication, while trapdoor functions are used for secure communication and encryption.

2. **Invertibility:** Secure hash functions are not designed to be invertible, while trapdoor functions are designed to be efficiently inverted with the trapdoor information.

3. **Key Usage:** Secure hash functions do not involve keys, while trapdoor functions use public and private keys, with the trapdoor as a secret component of the private key.

In conclusion, secure hash functions and trapdoor functions serve different cryptographic purposes and possess distinct properties. Secure hash functions focus on data integrity and do not involve secret information, whereas trapdoor functions enable secure communication and encryption by leveraging the concept of a secret trapdoor.

# Shor's Algorithm

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm devised by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. It is specifically designed to efficiently factor large integers into their prime factors. Factoring large integers into primes is a problem that classical computers find computationally challenging, especially when dealing with numbers that are the product of two large prime numbers. Shor's algorithm, however, demonstrates the potential advantage of quantum computers in solving this problem exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms.

The significance of Shor's algorithm stems from its potential to break widely used cryptographic schemes, such as the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) encryption system, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. If Shor's algorithm were efficiently implemented on a large-scale quantum computer, it could compromise the security of data encrypted using RSA.

**Algorithm Overview:**

Shor's algorithm accomplishes the task of integer factorization in two main steps:

1. **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT):**
   - The algorithm begins with the preparation of a quantum state that encodes the problem of factoring.
   - It uses quantum operations to perform a quantum Fourier transform on this state.
   - The QFT step is the key to Shor's algorithm's efficiency, as it leverages quantum superposition and entanglement to explore multiple possible factors simultaneously.

2. **Period Finding:**
   - After the QFT, Shor's algorithm measures the quantum state, collapsing it into a classical result.
   - The measured result provides information about the period of a particular mathematical function associated with the factoring problem.
   - From the period, which can be found efficiently using quantum techniques, the factors of the original integer can be determined.

**Complexity Analysis:**

The classical algorithms for integer factorization, such as the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), have a sub-exponential time complexity, which means their running time grows faster than polynomial time but slower than exponential time. Shor's algorithm, on the other hand, has a polynomial time complexity. It can factor an integer of length `n` bits in polynomial time, typically O(n^3) for the QFT step.

**Relevance and Implications:**

Shor's algorithm has far-reaching implications for cryptography and cybersecurity. If large-scale quantum computers capable of efficiently implementing Shor's algorithm become a reality, widely used encryption methods that rely on integer factorization, like RSA, would become vulnerable. This has led to increased research into post-quantum cryptography, which aims to develop encryption schemes that remain secure even in the era of quantum computing.

In conclusion, Shor's algorithm represents a significant milestone in the field of quantum computing, demonstrating the potential for quantum computers to solve problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. Its relevance extends to the realm of cryptography, where it poses a potential threat to widely used encryption schemes, necessitating the exploration of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.

# Theorems and Proofs for Shor's Algorithms
**Theorems and Proofs for Shor's Algorithm:**

Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to factor large composite numbers efficiently, posing a potential threat to classical public-key cryptography systems. Several key theorems and proofs underpin Shor's Algorithm's functioning and efficiency. Let's explore some of these essential mathematical foundations:

**Theorem 1: [[Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)]] and Period Finding**
*The Quantum Fourier Transform applied to periodic states yields a probability distribution with peaks at i                                nteger multiples of the period.*

**Proof:**
Consider a quantum state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} |x\rangle |f(x)\rangle$ where $f(x)$ is a periodic function with period $r$. Applying the QFT to this state results in the following transformation:

$$
QFT\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} |x\rangle |f(x)\rangle\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\sum_{y=0}^{r-1} \left(\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} e^{2\pi ixy/N}\right) |y\rangle |f(y)\rangle
$$

The inner summation in the parentheses simplifies using geometric series to $\frac{N}{r}$ when $x$ is a multiple of $r$, and it is 0 otherwise. Therefore, the QFT results in:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\sum_{y=0}^{r-1} \sqrt{\frac{N}{r}} \delta_{yr} |y\rangle |f(y)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\sum_{y=0}^{r-1} \sqrt{\frac{N}{r}} |y\rangle |f(y)\rangle
$$

This transformed state has a probability distribution with peaks at integer multiples of $r$. Measuring this state will give a value close to an integer multiple of the period with high probability.

**Theorem 2: Period Finding in Shor's Algorithm**
*Shor's Algorithm can find the period $r$ of a periodic function $f(x)$ in polynomial time on a quantum computer.*

**Proof:**
1. Shor's Algorithm starts with a quantum state that encodes the problem of factoring into period finding.

2. It applies the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), as shown in Theorem 1, which results in a state with peaks at integer multiples of $r$, the period of $f(x)$.

3. Measuring this state provides an approximation of $r$ with high probability.

4. Using continued fractions, the algorithm efficiently finds the fraction $a/b$ that approximates $r$. When $b$ is even, it is likely to be a nontrivial factor of $N$, and $a$ can be used to find a nontrivial factor of $N$ via the greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Theorem 3: Shor's Algorithm's Time Complexity**
*Shor's Algorithm can factor an integer $N$ of $n$ bits in polynomial time, typically O(n^3) for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) step.*

**Proof:**
The time complexity of Shor's Algorithm primarily depends on the QFT step, which involves the manipulation of $n$ qubits. The QFT operation itself has a time complexity of O(n^2), and it is applied twice, leading to a time complexity of O(2n^2), which simplifies to O(n^2).

However, the QFT step is embedded within modular exponentiation, which is performed O(n) times in the algorithm. Therefore, the overall time complexity of Shor's Algorithm is O(n^3).

In summary, these theorems and proofs establish the mathematical foundations and efficiency of Shor's Algorithm in factoring large integers, highlighting its potential impact on classical cryptography systems and the need for post-quantum cryptographic solutions.
