Euler's Theorem on Primes, not to be confused with Euler's Totient Theorem, is a beautiful statement about the distribution of prime numbers. This theorem is often overshadowed by the more famous Prime Number Theorem, yet it holds significant importance in number theory. Euler's Theorem on Primes can be stated as follows:

**Theorem:** For every positive integer $n$, there exists a prime number $p$ such that $n < p < 2n$.

This theorem assures us that for any positive integer $n$, we can always find a prime number greater than $n$ but less than $2n$. This is a precursor to Bertrand's Postulate and sets the stage for deeper explorations into the distribution of primes.

**Proof:**

To prove this theorem, we can use a method that involves estimating the number of primes in a given range and showing that at least one prime must exist in that range for every $n$. The proof, while not overly complex, requires a careful consideration of the properties of prime numbers and their distribution.

1. **Assumption:** Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is no prime number between $n$ and $2n$.

2. **Prime Factorization:** Consider the product $P = (n+1)(n+2)\cdots(2n)$. This product consists of $n$ consecutive integers. Under our assumption, none of these integers can be prime. Thus, each of them must be a product of primes less than or equal to $n$.

3. **Counting Prime Factors:** Let us count the number of times a particular prime $p \leq n$ appears in the prime factorization of $P$. For a prime $p$, it will divide about $\frac{n}{p}$ numbers in the set $\{n+1, n+2, \ldots, 2n\}$. However, $p^2$ will divide about $\frac{n}{p^2}$ of these numbers, $p^3$ will divide about $\frac{n}{p^3}$ of them, and so on.

4. **Estimating the Exponent:** The total exponent of $p$ in the factorization of $P$ is approximately $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{p^k}$. Since $\frac{n}{p^k}$ becomes negligibly small for large $k$, this series converges.

5. **Contradiction:** Since $P$ is a product of $n$ consecutive integers, it must have at least one factor of $n+1$. However, under our assumption, all the factors of $P$ are primes less than or equal to $n$. This is a contradiction because $n+1$ cannot be factored entirely into primes that are all less than or equal to $n$.

6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. Hence, there must be at least one prime number between $n$ and $2n$ for every positive integer $n$.

This proof, though not the original one given by Euler, captures the essence of his argument. It elegantly combines the fundamental theorem of arithmetic with a clever counting argument to reveal a profound truth about the distribution of prime numbers.


# Dirichlet's Prime Number Theorem
Dirichlet's Prime Number Theorem is a profound result in number theory, especially in the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. The theorem elegantly fuses the realms of algebra, analysis, and number theory. Let's delve into its essence with both mathematical rigor and poetic eloquence.

The theorem states:

$$ \text{If } a \text{ and } d \text{ are coprime integers (i.e., gcd}(a, d) = 1), \text{ then there}
\text{ are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression } a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots $$

In simpler terms, if you start with any integer $a$ and keep adding a fixed integer $d$ to it (where $a$ and $d$ share no common divisors other than 1), you will encounter infinitely many prime numbers in this sequence.

This result was groundbreaking be cause it extended the idea of the distribution of primes beyond the natural sequence of numbers. Until Dirichlet, the prime number theorem, which asserts that the number of primes less than a given number $x$ approximates $\frac{x}{\log(x)}$, only dealt with the natural order of numbers.

Dirichlet's approach to proving this theorem was equally fascinating. He introduced what are now known as Dirichlet characters and L-functions. These tools not only proved the theorem but also opened new pathways in the field of analytic number theory.

The beauty of this theorem lies in its assertion that primes, the building blocks of number theory, are not just randomly scattered but follow a sublime harmony even in the labyrinth of arithmetic progressions. The theorem reveals an underlying order and structure in the distribution of primes, showcasing the intricate tapestry woven by these fundamental entities of mathematics.

# Proof of a consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem
Let's explore and prove the given statement with the requested rigor. Given that $p$ and $q$ are primes, and $p$ divides $a^{q} - 1$, we want to prove:

$$\text{If } p \mid a^{q} - 1, \text{ then either } p \equiv 1 \mod q \text{ or } a^{q} \equiv 1 \mod p.$$

Here's the proof, formatted in a structured manner:

**Lemma (Fermat's Little Theorem):** If $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$.

**Proof:**

**1. Assume $p \mid a^{q} - 1$.** This means that $a^{q} \equiv 1 \mod p$.

**2. Let's consider the order of $a$ modulo $p$, denoted by $\text{ord}_p(a)$.** This is the smallest positive integer $r$ such that $a^r \equiv 1 \mod p$. By the definition of divisibility in modular arithmetic, we know that $q$ must be a multiple of $\text{ord}_p(a)$ since $a^{q} \equiv 1 \mod p$.

**3. Since $q$ is prime, the possible values for $\text{ord}_p(a)$ are $1$ and $q$** because the order of an element must divide any exponent that yields a congruence of 1 mod $p$.

**4. If $\text{ord}_p(a) = 1$, then $a \equiv 1 \mod p$.** However, this would mean $a^{q} - 1$ is $0$ modulo $p$ for any $q$, which doesn't give us any specific information about $p$ and $q$. So, we consider the case when $\text{ord}_p(a) = q$.

**5. If $\text{ord}_p(a) = q$, then $q \mid p-1$.** This is due to Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of an element modulo $p$ must divide $p-1$ when $p$ is prime. Hence, we have $p-1 = kq$ for some integer $k$, which implies that $p \equiv 1 \mod q$.

**6. Therefore, we have two possibilities:**
   - $\text{ord}_p(a) = 1$, which leads to $a \equiv 1 \mod p$, satisfying the second condition of our initial statement.
   - $\text{ord}_p(a) = q$, which leads to $p \equiv 1 \mod q$, satisfying the first condition of our initial statement.

**7. Conclusion:** Since these are the only two possibilities for the order of $a$ modulo $p$, and both lead to the conditions outlined in our statement, we have proved that if $p$ divides $a^{q} - 1$, then either $p \equiv 1 \mod q$ or $a^{q} \equiv 1 \mod p$.

This theorem is a beautiful example of the interplay between algebraic structures and number theory, showcasing how prime numbers can exhibit regular patterns in the seemingly chaotic universe of integers.

# Weaker Form of Fermat's Little Theorem
The statement from the image you've provided is a variant of Fermat's Little Theorem, often referred to as the weak form. It can be stated formally as follows:

If $a$ is an integer and $m$ is a prime number, then for any integers $x$ and $y$ with $x > y$, it holds that $a^x \equiv a^y \mod m$ for some $x > y$.

Before proving this statement, we must acknowledge that the standard Fermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$. The weak form is more general in that it does not require $a$ to be coprime with $m$.

Now let us proceed with the proof:

**Proof:**

1. **Consider any integer $a$ and a prime $m$.** We want to prove that there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x > y$ and $a^x \equiv a^y \mod m$.

2. **Look at the sequence $a^1, a^2, a^3, \ldots, a^m, \ldots, a^{m+1}, \ldots$.** Since there are infinitely many exponents but only $m$ distinct residues modulo $m$, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two powers of $a$ that are congruent modulo $m$, say $a^x$ and $a^y$ with $x > y$.

3. **When $x$ and $y$ satisfy this condition, we can write $a^x \equiv a^y \mod m$.** This means that $m$ divides $a^x - a^y$.

4. **Now, consider $a^x - a^y = a^y(a^{x-y} - 1)$.** If $m$ divides this expression, then $m$ divides either $a^y$ or $a^{x-y} - 1$. If $m$ divides $a^y$, then we are done. If not, then $m$ must divide $a^{x-y} - 1$.

5. **Thus, we have established that $a^{x-y} \equiv 1 \mod m$ or $a^x \equiv a^y \mod m$.** This implies that for some integers $x$ and $y$ where $x > y$, the congruence holds.

The elegance of this proof lies in its reliance on the fundamental principle of counting, demonstrating that within the constraints of modular arithmetic, repetition is inevitableâ€”a truth as simple as it is profound. This property of integers ensures that even when numbers soar to great heights in their exponential flight, they must eventually return to familiar grounds in the modular space.

# Invertibility in Modular Arithmetic
The statement that numbers coprime to a positive integer \(x\) are a disjoint union of cycles might not be entirely clear without further context. However, it seems like you might be referring to a concept related to group theory, particularly in the context of multiplicative groups modulo \(x\).

Let's break down the idea:

1. **Coprime Numbers**: Two integers are coprime (or relatively prime) if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In the context of modular arithmetic, integers that are coprime to \(x\) are those that do not share any common factors (other than 1) with \(x\). These are often referred to as the elements of the multiplicative group modulo \(x\).

2. **Disjoint Union of Cycles**: In group theory, especially when discussing permutations or cycles, a disjoint union of cycles refers to expressing a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. In this case, it seems you want to express the coprime integers to \(x\) as a collection of disjoint cycles.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: In modular arithmetic, the set of integers coprime to \(x\) forms a group under multiplication modulo \(x\). This group is often denoted as \(\mathbb{Z}_x^*\) or \(\phi(x)\), where \(\phi\) is Euler's totient function. The elements of this group can indeed be expressed as disjoint cycles if you are considering their actions as permutations.

For example, let's take \(x = 12\). The numbers coprime to 12 are \(\{1, 5, 7, 11\}\), and you can express their multiplicative actions modulo 12 as disjoint cycles:

- \(1\) maps to \(1\) (cycle of length 1).
- \(5\) maps to \(5\) (cycle of length 1).
- \(7\) maps to \(7\) (cycle of length 1).
- \(11\) maps to \(11\) (cycle of length 1).

In this case, these are disjoint cycles because none of these numbers share any common factors with 12, and their multiplicative actions do not overlap.

So, the statement holds true when you consider the elements coprime to \(x\) as permutations in the context of modular arithmetic. However, the concept of disjoint cycles is more commonly associated with permutation groups, so it's important to provide context when discussing this in the context of number theory or modular arithmetic.


# Modular Classes as a disjoint union of cycles
The statement that numbers co-prime to a modulus $x$ form a disjoint union of cycles of some order is closely related to the structure of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $x$, denoted as $(\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$. This group comprises all integers less than $x$ that are co-prime to $x$. The cycle structure in this context refers to the behavior under repeated application of multiplication modulo $x$.

### Theorem: Structure of $(\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$

1. **Existence of Multiplicative Group**: For any positive integer $x$, the set $\((\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*\)$ forms a group under multiplication modulo $x$. An element $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$ if and only if $\gcd(a, x) = 1$.

2. **Cyclic Groups**: If $x$ is a prime number, then $\((\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*\)$ is a cyclic group. This means every element can be expressed as a power of a single generator.

3. **Disjoint Cycles**: In the general case, when $x$ is not necessarily prime, the structure of \(($\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$\) can be more complex. However, it still consists of disjoint cycles under multiplication. Each cycle corresponds to an orbit of an element under the action of multiplication.

4. **Order of Elements**: The order of an element $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{x}$. The order divides $\phi(x)$, where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function.

### Proof and Discussion

To illustrate these principles, let's consider a specific example and analyze it rigorously.

#### Example: Modulus $x = 10$

Consider the group $(\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z})^*)$), which consists of the numbers $\{1, 3, 7, 9\}$ since these are co-prime to $10$. Now let's examine the multiplication cycles:

- The element $1$ forms a cycle of length $1$: $1^1 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$.
- The element $3$ forms a cycle of length $4$: $3^1 \equiv 3$, $3^2 \equiv 9$, $3^3 \equiv 7$, $3^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$.
- The element $7$ and $9$ will form similar cycles.

This example demonstrates the concept of disjoint cycles within the multiplicative group modulo $x$.

### Generalization and Rigorous Proof

1. **Existence of Group**: Proving $(\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$ is a group involves showing closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and inverses, all modulo $x$.

2. **Cycle Structure**: The cycle structure can be rigorously analyzed using the concept of the order of elements and group theory. It relies on the fact that for any $a \in (\mathbb{Z}/x\mathbb{Z})^*$, there exists a $k$ such that $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{x}$, and this $k$ partitions the group into disjoint cycles.

3. **Cyclic and Non-Cyclic Cases**: In the case of a prime modulus, the cyclic nature of the group can be proved using Fermat's Little Theorem. For composite moduli, the structure can be more complex and often requires more advanced number theory, involving concepts like the Chinese Remainder Theorem and the structure of groups.

4. **Euler's Totient Function**: The role of $\phi(x)$, Euler's totient function, is crucial in understanding the order of elements and the structure of the group. It counts the number of integers less than $x$ that are co-prime to $x$, and it provides a bound on the order of the elements.

In summary, the statement about cycles and co-prime numbers modulo $x$ can be understood and proven within the framework of group theory and number theory. The precise structure depends on the nature of the modulus $x$ and involves deep and elegant mathematics.

# Euler's Totient Theorem
Euler's Totient Theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, deeply connected with the properties of modular arithmetic and the structure of groups. Named after the prolific mathematician Leonhard Euler, this theorem deals with the order of integers modulo $n$ and has significant implications in various fields, including cryptography and computer science.

The theorem states:

If $n$ is a positive integer and $a$ is an integer coprime to $n$ (i.e., $gcd(a, n) = 1$ where $gcd$ denotes the greatest common divisor), then
$$
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$
Here, $\varphi(n)$ represents Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers from $1$ to $n$ that are coprime to $n$. 

To illustrate with a poetic metaphor, imagine a clock with $n$ hours. Euler's theorem tells us that if we advance the hands of the clock by $a$ hours, $\varphi(n)$ times, we will inevitably return to the starting hour, provided that the number of hours ($n$) and the advancement ($a$) share no common divisors other than 1.

This theorem is particularly useful in the realm of public-key cryptography, especially in algorithms like RSA, where the properties of modular arithmetic and Euler's totient function play a pivotal role in securing digital communication.

# Lagrange's Theorem on Group Theorem
Lagrange's theorem, named after the Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is a cornerstone of group theory, a subfield of abstract algebra. The theorem establishes a relationship between the order of a subgroup and the order of the entire group within the context of finite groups. Let us express this elegant theorem and its implications using the succinct and precise language of mathematics:

**Lagrange's Theorem**: Consider a finite group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$. The theorem states that the order (cardinality) of $H$ is a divisor of the order of $G$. Mathematically, this is represented as:
$$ |H| \text{ divides } |G| $$

This theorem unfolds several profound consequences in the realm of group theory and beyond:

1. **Cosets**: From Lagrange's theorem, we infer that the order of any subgroup of a finite group is a divisor of the group's entire order. This notion further leads to the concept that a finite group can be partitioned into disjoint left cosets of the subgroup $H$, with each coset sharing the same cardinality as $H$, denoted as $|H|$.

2. **Cyclic Groups**: In the study of cyclic groups, Lagrange's theorem offers a straightforward method to ascertain the potential orders of subgroups. For a cyclic group $G$ with an order $n$, the order of any of its subgroups must be a factor of $n$. This insight is particularly valuable in number theory and related fields.

3. **Converse Not Necessarily True**: A crucial point to note is that the converse of Lagrange's theorem does not universally hold. In other words, the fact that $|H|$ divides $|G|$ does not guarantee the existence of a subgroup $H$ with the order $|H|$ in $G$. The existence of such subgroups is contingent on additional factors.

4. **Applications**: The implications of Lagrange's theorem extend across various mathematical disciplines, including abstract algebra, number theory, and cryptography. It sheds light on the structural nuances of finite groups and aids in classifying finite groups of smaller orders.

In essence, Lagrange's theorem serves as a foundational pillar in the study of group theory, often encountered at the outset of one's exploration of this field. It accentuates the significance of the order of elements and subgroups in comprehending the intricate properties of groups.

# Link between Lagrange's Theorem and Euler's Totient Function
Lagrange's Theorem and Euler's Totient Theorem, though arising from different areas of mathematics, intersect in a beautiful and profound manner, especially in the context of group theory and number theory. To appreciate this link, let's first briefly encapsulate each theorem:

1. **Lagrange's Theorem**: As previously discussed, this theorem in group theory states that for any finite group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$, the order of $H$ (denoted as $|H|$) divides the order of $G$ (denoted as $|G|$). Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   $$ |H| \text{ divides } |G| $$

2. **Euler's Totient Theorem**: In number theory, Euler's theorem states that if $n$ is a positive integer and $a$ is an integer coprime to $n$ (meaning $\gcd(a, n) = 1$), then $a$ raised to the power of $\phi(n)$ (Euler's totient function of $n$) is congruent to $1$ modulo $n$. This is expressed as:
   $$ a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n} $$

Now, let's explore the connection:

- **Cyclic Groups and Euler's Totient Function**: Consider a cyclic group $G$ of order $n$. According to Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup of $G$ must divide $n$. If we look at the group of units (invertible elements) under multiplication modulo $n$, denoted typically as $U(n)$, its order is given by $\phi(n)$, the Euler totient function of $n$. This group is cyclic for certain values of $n$, especially when $n$ is a prime or a power of a prime.

- **Lagrange in the Context of Euler's Theorem**: For any element $a$ in the group $U(n)$, Lagrange's Theorem tells us that the order of $a$ (the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$) divides $|U(n)|$, which is $\phi(n)$. Therefore, $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ for all $a$ coprime to $n$, a result that is exactly Euler's Totient Theorem.

- **A Unified Framework**: Both theorems can be viewed under the broader umbrella of group theory. Euler's theorem can be seen as a specific case of Lagrange's theorem applied to the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n$. This perspective not only unifies these seemingly disparate parts of mathematics but also illustrates the profound interconnectedness within the mathematical universe.

In summary, the link between Lagrange's Theorem and Euler's Totient Theorem is established through the lens of group theory, particularly in the setting of cyclic groups and the group of units modulo $n$. Euler's theorem emerges as a special case of Lagrange's theorem, applied to the specific group structure of integers under multiplication modulo $n$. This connection is a testament to the elegance and depth of mathematical structures and their interrelationships.

# Primitive Roots
Primitive roots in modular arithmetic and roots of unity in complex analysis share a fascinating conceptual similarity, both embodying cyclic structures in their respective mathematical realms.

### Primitive Roots in Modular Arithmetic

A primitive root modulo $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, is an integer $g$ such that every number coprime to $n$ is congruent to a power of $g$ modulo $n$. Essentially, $g$ generates all the units in the modular arithmetic system modulo $n$ through its powers.

Mathematically, if $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to $n$ that are coprime to $n$, then $g$ is a primitive root modulo $n$ if:

$$
\{g^1 \mod n, g^2 \mod n, \ldots, g^{\phi(n)} \mod n\}
$$

produces a complete set of distinct units modulo $n$.

### Roots of Unity in Complex Analysis

Roots of unity, on the other hand, are solutions to the equation $z^n = 1$ in the complex plane, where $n$ is a positive integer. These roots form a regular polygon on the complex unit circle. For a given $n$, there are $n$ distinct $n$-th roots of unity, often denoted as:

$$
\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i k}{n}\right), \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1
$$

Here, each root is a complex number that, when raised to the $n$-th power, equals 1. They exhibit a cyclic pattern, much like the powers of a primitive root modulo $n$.

### The Analogy

The analogy between primitive roots and roots of unity lies in their cyclic nature and their role in generating a complete set of distinct elements within their domains. In modular arithmetic, a primitive root modulo $n$ generates all units modulo $n$ through its powers. Similarly, in complex analysis, the $n$-th roots of unity form a complete set of distinct solutions to $z^n = 1$, with a cyclic structure on the unit circle.

The elegance of this analogy is further highlighted by the periodicity inherent in both concepts: the powers of a primitive root eventually repeat modulo $n$, and the roots of unity repeat as we circle the unit circle in the complex plane. This cyclical symmetry reveals a deep connection between abstract algebra and complex analysis, showcasing the beauty of mathematics in unifying seemingly disparate concepts.

# Last two digits of 7^403 
To find the last two digits of $7^{403}$, we need to compute $7^{403} \mod 100$. This problem involves modular arithmetic and specifically focuses on finding a pattern in the powers of 7 modulo 100. Let's break down the process:

1. **Modular Reduction:** The last two digits of a number are the remainder when the number is divided by 100. So, we are effectively finding $7^{403} \mod 100$.

2. **Pattern Finding:** Large powers can be simplified by finding patterns or cycles in the remainders when raised to successive powers.

3. **Applying Euler's Totient Function:** Euler's theorem can be a useful tool here. It states that if $a$ and $n$ are coprime, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$, where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function. However, since 7 and 100 are not coprime (they share a common factor of 7), we can't apply Euler's theorem directly. We need to find the pattern through manual calculation.

4. **Manual Computation:** We will calculate $7^n \mod 100$ for various values of $n$ and look for a repeating pattern.

I will calculate the first few powers of 7 modulo 100 and look for a repeating cycle that can be used to find $7^{403} \mod 100$.

The sequence of powers of 7 modulo 100 starts to repeat after every 4 terms: 7, 49, 43, 1, and then it cycles back to 7. This pattern suggests a cycle length of 4.

To find $7^{403} \mod 100$, we can now use this cycle. Since 403 modulo 4 gives us the position in the cycle:

- 403 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 100 with a remainder of 3.

Therefore, $7^{403} \mod 100$ is equivalent to the third number in our repeating cycle, which is 43. 

Hence, the last two digits of $7^{403}$ are 43.

# Last Digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$
To find the last digit of an expression like $7^{7^{7^7}}$, we focus on the last digit of each exponentiation step, working from the top down. The last digit of a number in base-10 is determined by its residue modulo 10. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the Last Digit of $7^7$:** The last digit of powers of 7 follows a pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then repeats. Since $7^4$ ends in 1, and powers of 7 repeat every 4 steps, we can find the last digit of $7^7$ by calculating $7^{7 \mod 4}$, which is the same as $7^3$.

2. **Compute the Last Digit of $7^{7^7}$:** After determining the last digit of $7^7$, we use this as the exponent for the next step. The pattern for the last digit will still follow the 7, 9, 3, 1 cycle.

3. **Compute the Last Digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$:** Finally, we use the last digit found in the previous step as the exponent for $7^{\text{(last digit of } 7^{7^7})}$.

Let's start by computing the last digit of $7^7$.

The last digit of $7^7$ is 3. 

Now, we need to determine the last digit of $7^{7^7}$. We know that $7^{7^7}$ ends in the same digit as $7^3$ because the last digit pattern of powers of 7 repeats every 4 steps, and 3 is the last digit we just calculated for $7^7$.

So, we calculate the last digit of $7^3$:

The last digit of $7^3$ is also 3.

Finally, we find the last digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$. Given that the last digit of $7^{7^7}$ is 3, we only need to find the last digit of $7^3$, which we already know is 3.

Therefore, the last digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$ is 3.

# Last Digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$ using the Euler Totient Function
To elegantly reformulate the explanation of using Euler's Totient Theorem for finding the last digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$, let us embark on a journey through the realm of modular arithmetic and Euler's theorem, delicately interwoven with [[Carmichael's function]].

Euler's Theorem, a cornerstone in this quest, proclaims that if $a$ and $n$ are coprime, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$, where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function.

In our quest for the last digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$, we venture into the world of modulo 10. Alas, 7 and 10 share no common factors aside from 1, rendering them coprime. This twist in our tale necessitates a turn to Carmichael's function, a refined tool in our arsenal. For modulus 10, Carmichael's function whispers the number 4, revealing that any number coprime to 10 raised to this power echoes 1 in the realm of modulo 10.

Our expedition unfolds in the following steps:

1. **Unraveling the First Layer: $7^7 \mod 4$:** Guided by the wisdom of Carmichael's function, we first seek the exponent for our subsequent journey by calculating $7^7 \mod 4$.

2. **Ascending to the Next Echelon: $7^{7^7} \mod 4$:** Armed with the outcome of the first step, we raise 7 to this newfound exponent, continuing our dance with modulus 4.

3. **The Culmination: $7^{7^{7^7}} \mod 10$:** Finally, we wield the result from the second step as our exponent in $7^{7^{7^7}}$, seeking the answer in the land of modulo 10.

Embarking on this calculation, we find:

- The first revelation, $7^7 \mod 4$, unveils 3 as its secret. Thus, we proceed to compute $7^3 \mod 4$.

- This calculation, too, unveils a 3. Our final act, therefore, is to unveil the last digit of $7^3$ within the confines of modulo 10.

Given the cyclical whispers of powers in modular arithmetic, where the powers of 7 echo every 4 steps in modulo 10, the last digit of $7^3$ is all we need. As we've discerned, $7^3$ concludes with a 3, revealing that the last digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$ is, indeed, 3.

In this poetic and mathematical odyssey, Euler's Totient Theorem, when augmented with Carmichael's function, gracefully simplifies our quest in the vast seas of modular arithmetic, leading us to the last digit of $7^{7^{7^7}}$ as 3.
