# Chance of a number n being prime, when n is less than or equal to N
To determine the chance of a number, denoted as $n$, being prime when $n$ is less than or equal to a given positive integer $N$, we can formulate this problem as a probability question. Let's denote the probability that a randomly selected number less than or equal to $N$ is prime as $P(\text{prime})$.

We can express this probability as the ratio of the number of prime numbers in the range $[1, N]$ to the total number of integers in the same range. In mathematical notation:

$$
P(\text{prime}) = \frac{\text{Number of Primes in } [1, N]}{\text{Total Number of Integers in } [1, N]}
$$

Now, let's break down the components of this expression:

1. **Number of Primes in** $[1, N]$: This represents the count of prime numbers within the given range. We can use the Prime Number Theorem to provide an estimate for this count. The Prime Number Theorem states that the approximate number of prime numbers less than or equal to a positive integer $N$ is given by:

   $$\pi(N) \approx \frac{N}{\ln(N)}$$

   Here, $\pi(N)$ represents the prime-counting function.

2. **Total Number of Integers in** $[1, N]$: This corresponds to the total count of integers within the range $[1, N]$. Since we're including all positive integers up to $N$, this count is simply $N$.

Now, let's calculate $P(\text{prime})$ using the Prime Number Theorem:

$$
P(\text{prime}) \approx \frac{\pi(N)}{N} \approx \frac{\frac{N}{\ln(N)}}{N} = \frac{1}{\ln(N)}
$$

So, the chance of a randomly selected number $n$ being prime when $n$ is less than or equal to $N$ is approximately $\frac{1}{\ln(N)}$.

This result tells us that as $N$ increases, the probability of randomly selecting a prime number from the range $[1, N]$ decreases logarithmically. It also highlights the significance of the natural logarithm $\ln(N)$ in understanding the distribution of prime numbers in this range.

As an inquisitive question, one might wonder how the probability changes for different values of $N$ or explore how close this approximation is to the actual probability in specific cases.

# Probability of Mersenne Primes being infinite
The question at hand concerns the probability of the number of Mersenne primes being infinite. To approach this question mathematically, we need to consider the properties and characteristics of Mersenne primes and explore whether they are likely to be finite or infinite in number.

Let's denote the set of Mersenne primes as $\mathcal{M}$. Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be expressed in the form $2^p - 1$, where $p$ is also a prime number. A well-known theorem in number theory is the Lucas-Lehmer primality test, which can be used to determine whether a Mersenne number of the form $2^p - 1$ is prime or not when $p$ is a prime number. 

The Lucas-Lehmer test states that a Mersenne number $2^p - 1$ is prime if and only if $p$ is a prime number and $2^p - 1$ divides a specific sequence generated by the Lucas-Lehmer recurrence relation. This result implies that not all Mersenne numbers are prime, but it does not guarantee that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.

To analyze the probability of the number of Mersenne primes being infinite, we need to consider whether there are infinitely many prime numbers $p$ such that $2^p - 1$ is also prime. This is a well-known open question in number theory, known as the infinitude of Mersenne primes.

The infinitude of Mersenne primes is related to the infinitude of prime numbers, which is a well-established result known as Euclid's theorem. Euclid's theorem states that there are infinitely many prime numbers. However, proving the infinitude of Mersenne primes is a more challenging problem.

# Probability that Mersenne Primes are Infinite

The argument presented in the image can be reformulated using LaTeX formatting as follows:

1. Consider the reciprocal of a Mersenne prime $\ M_n$ in the form $\( \frac{1}{M_n} = \frac{1}{2^n - 1} \).$

3. Express this reciprocal as a sum of an infinite geometric series:
   $\[ \frac{1}{2^n - 1} = \frac{1}{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{1}{2^{2n}} + \cdots \right) \]$.

3. Summing over all \( n \), we obtain an expression $\( \sum \frac{k}{n} \)$, where \( k \) is a constant.

4. This sum is equated to $k \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots \right)$, which diverges to infinity, similar to the harmonic series.

The heuristic suggests that if there were only a finite number of Mersenne primes, this sum would not diverge. However, because the sum diverges, it implies that there must be infinitely many terms contributing to it, and thus, infinitely many Mersenne primes.

However, it's important to note that this is not a formal proof of the infinitude of Mersenne primes. A counterexample is $2^n - 2$, where using the same argument seems to suggest that these numbers are infinitely prime as well, which is not the case.

# Reimann's Prime Formula

The Riemann Prime Formula is a significant result in number theory formulated by the mathematician Bernhard Riemann. It provides a way to count the number of prime numbers up to a certain limit. The formula is expressed as:

$$
\pi(x) \sim \frac{1}{\ln(x)}
$$

Where:
- $\pi(x)$ represents the prime counting function, which counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to $x$.
- $x$ is the limit up to which we want to count prime numbers.
- $\ln(x)$ is the natural logarithm of $x$.

This formula suggests that the density of prime numbers decreases as we examine larger and larger values of $x$. In other words, as $x$ grows, the ratio of primes to non-primes becomes smaller, and this ratio can be approximated by $\frac{1}{\ln(x)}$. 

This result is essential in understanding the distribution of prime numbers and has applications in various areas of mathematics and cryptography. It is closely related to the Riemann zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis, which is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

Axiomatic Approach:

To delve deeper into the Riemann Prime Formula, we can use the following axiomatic approach:

**Axiom 1**: The Prime Counting Function
The prime counting function $\pi(x)$ is defined as the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given real number $x$. This function is fundamental to our understanding of prime numbers.

**Theorem 1**: The Logarithmic Integral Function
Let $Li(x)$ be the logarithmic integral function defined as:
$$
Li(x) = \int_2^x \frac{1}{\ln(t)} dt
$$
where $\ln(t)$ is the natural logarithm of $t$. Then, it can be proven that $Li(x)$ is an asymptotic approximation of $\pi(x)$ as $x$ becomes large:
$$
\pi(x) \sim Li(x) \quad \text{as} \quad x \rightarrow \infty
$$

**Theorem 2**: Riemann's Prime Formula
Riemann's Prime Formula is given by:
$$
\pi(x) \sim \frac{1}{\ln(x)}
$$
This formula establishes a relationship between the prime counting function $\pi(x)$ and the natural logarithm of $x$.

**Corollary 1**: Approximation of Prime Density
As a direct consequence of Riemann's Prime Formula, we conclude that the density of prime numbers decreases as $x$ grows. The rate of decrease is inversely proportional to the natural logarithm of $x$.

# Riemann's Prime Powers Formula
Riemann's Function of Prime Powers is defined as follows:

$$
R(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n} \pi\left(\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)^{1/n}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\mu(n)$ is the Möbius function, which equals 1 if $n$ is square-free with an even number of prime factors, -1 if $n$ is square-free with an odd number of prime factors, and 0 if $n$ is not square-free.
- $\pi(x)$ is the prime-counting function, which counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to $x$.

This function plays a crucial role in number theory, particularly in understanding the distribution of prime powers.

### Properties and Questions:

1. **Convergence**: Does the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n} \pi\left(\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)^{1/n}\right)$ converge for all real values of $x$? What can be said about its convergence properties?

2. **Prime Number Theorem**: How does Riemann's Function of Prime Powers relate to the Prime Number Theorem, which states that $\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\ln(x)}$ as $x$ approaches infinity?

3. **Möbius Function**: What is the significance of the Möbius function $\mu(n)$ in the definition of Riemann's Function of Prime Powers? How does it affect the contributions of different terms in the series?

4. **Prime Power Counting**: How does Riemann's Function of Prime Powers help us count prime powers, i.e., numbers that are powers of prime numbers? Can it be used to determine the density or distribution of prime powers?

5. **Generalization**: Are there any known generalizations or variations of Riemann's Function of Prime Powers that incorporate different arithmetic functions or prime-related concepts?

Understanding and analyzing the properties of Riemann's Function of Prime Powers is essential for deeper insights into the distribution of prime numbers and their powers, which are fundamental topics in number theory.
