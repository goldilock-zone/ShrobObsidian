# Proof Of Binomial Theorem
The Binomial Theorem is a fundamental result in algebra that provides a formula for expanding expressions raised to a power. Specifically, it describes the expansion of the power of a binomial (a two-term expression). For any positive integer $n$, the theorem states that:

$$ (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k $$

where $\binom{n}{k}$ is a binomial coefficient, defined as $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

Let's prove this theorem using mathematical induction.

### Basis Step:

First, we verify the theorem for $n = 1$. 

For $n = 1$, the left-hand side of the theorem is $(a + b)^1 = a + b$. The right-hand side is $\sum_{k=0}^{1} \binom{1}{k} a^{1-k} b^k$. Calculating the terms individually:

- For $k = 0$, the term is $\binom{1}{0} a^1 b^0 = 1 \cdot a \cdot 1 = a$.
- For $k = 1$, the term is $\binom{1}{1} a^0 b^1 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot b = b$.

Adding these, we get $a + b$, which matches the left-hand side. Thus, the basis step is verified.

### Inductive Step:

Now, assume the theorem is true for some positive integer $n$, that is:

$$ (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k $$

We need to show that the theorem holds for $n + 1$. Consider the expression $(a + b)^{n+1}$. This can be written as $(a + b)^n(a + b)$. Using the distributive property:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = (a + b)^n \cdot a + (a + b)^n \cdot b $$

Applying the inductive hypothesis to $(a + b)^n$, we have:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \right) a + \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \right) b $$

Expanding each sum, we get:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k+1} b^k + \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^{k+1} $$

Notice that in the second sum, we can change the index $k$ to $k-1$ to align the powers of $b$:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k+1} b^k + \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \binom{n}{k-1} a^{n-(k-1)} b^k $$

Now, we need to combine these two sums. The first sum has terms from $k=0$ to $n$, and the second sum has terms from $k=1$ to $n+1$. The term for $k=0$ in the first sum is $a^{n+1}$, and the term for $k=n+1$ in the second sum is $b^{n+1}$. All other terms can be combined using the identity $\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1} = \binom{n+1}{k}$:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = a^{n+1} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1} \right) a^{n+1-k} b^k + b^{n+1} $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = a^{n+1} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n+1}{k} a^{n+1-k} b^k + b^{n+1} $$

Combining all terms into a single sum, we finally have:

$$ (a + b)^{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n

+1} \binom{n+1}{k} a^{n+1-k} b^k $$

This completes the inductive step, proving that the theorem holds for $n + 1$ if it holds for $n$.

### Conclusion:

By the principle of mathematical induction, the Binomial Theorem is true for all positive integers $n$.

# Proof of the Multinomial Coefficient
The multinomial coefficient theorem is a generalization of the binomial theorem and describes how a sum raised to a power can be expanded into a sum of products. To prove this theorem rigorously, we will rely on combinatorial arguments and the concept of multinomial coefficients. Let's start by stating the theorem.

### Theorem: Multinomial Coefficient Theorem

Given a sum of $k$ terms $(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k)^n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer, the expansion of this sum can be written as:

$$
(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k)^n = \sum \binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k} x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \cdots x_k^{n_k}
$$

where the sum is taken over all sequences of non-negative integers $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ such that $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k = n$. The coefficient $\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k}$ is the multinomial coefficient, defined as:

$$
\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
$$

### Proof

1. **Basis of Expansion**: Consider the expansion of $(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k)^n$. Each term in the expansion is obtained by selecting one of the $x_i$'s from each of the $n$ factors and then multiplying them together.

2. **Combinatorial Interpretation**: The term $x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \cdots x_k^{n_k}$ corresponds to a particular way of choosing $n_1$ instances of $x_1$, $n_2$ instances of $x_2$, ..., and $n_k$ instances of $x_k$ from the $n$ factors, such that $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k = n$.

3. **Counting the Occurrences**: The number of ways to choose these terms is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange a sequence of $n$ items, where there are $n_1$ items of one type, $n_2$ items of another type, ..., and $n_k$ items of the last type. This is a problem of counting the permutations of a multiset.

4. **Multiset Permutation Formula**: The number of distinct permutations of a multiset of $n$ objects, with $n_1$ objects of one type, $n_2$ of another, ..., and $n_k$ of the last type, is given by dividing the factorial of the total number of objects by the product of the factorials of the number of identical objects of each type:

   $$
   \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
   $$

5. **Concluding the Proof**: Thus, each distinct term $x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \cdots x_k^{n_k}$ occurs exactly $\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}$ times in the expansion of $(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k)^n$. Summing over all possible combinations of $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ that sum to $n$ gives the full expansion.

This completes the proof. The multinomial coefficient theorem elegantly generalizes the binomial theorem and provides a powerful tool for combinatorial analysis and algebraic expansions.

# Note
- If the binomial coefficient is made using pascal's triangle, the trinomial coefficient is made using pascal's tetrahedron.
	Yes, that statement is true. While Pascal's triangle is used to generate binomial coefficients, Pascal's tetrahedron is used to generate trinomial coefficients.
	
	Pascal's triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers where each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The numbers in Pascal's triangle are used to calculate binomial coefficients, which appear in binomial expansions and combinatorial counting problems.
	
	Pascal's tetrahedron is a three-dimensional extension of Pascal's triangle. It is a pyramid-like arrangement of numbers, and each number in Pascal's tetrahedron is the sum of the three numbers directly above it. The numbers in Pascal's tetrahedron are used to calculate trinomial coefficients, which arise in trinomial expansions and other mathematical contexts where three terms are involved.
	
	So, to summarize, Pascal's triangle is used for binomial coefficients, and Pascal's tetrahedron is used for trinomial coefficients.

# Proof of Non Negativity
The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer $n$, the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ is given by:

$$ (a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k $$

where $\binom{n}{k}$ is a binomial coefficient, and it denotes the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements without considering the order of selection. The binomial coefficients form the elements of Pascal's Triangle and have the property that:

$$ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$

Now, to prove that binomial coefficients are integers for any non-negative integer $n$:

- It is evident that $n!$, the factorial of $n$, is an integer for any non-negative integer $n$.
- For each term in the sum, $k!(n-k)!$ is a product of integers and thus also an integer.
- Since $k \leq n$, both $k!$ and $(n-k)!$ are factors of $n!$. Hence, the division $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is actually a division of an integer by some of its factors, which guarantees an integer result.

Now for the property of upper triangularity, it can be seen in Pascal's Triangle where all non-zero elements are confined to the upper-left-to-lower-right diagonal, starting from the 1 at the top. Each row corresponds to a power of $(a+b)$, and the elements outside of this triangular area are zeros. This triangularity can be explained because $\binom{n}{k}$ is defined to be zero when $k > n$, which means there are no ways to choose more elements than the set has.

In summary, binomial coefficients are integers due to the factorial definition and the properties of division within the factorials. The upper triangularity is a result of the definition of binomial coefficients for $k > n$. If you need a more mathematical or visual explanation, let me know, and I can provide further assistance.

# Proof of Non Negativity of the polynomial coefficients
The image you've provided contains a handwritten mathematical expression, which appears to be a finite sum of products of some coefficients $a_i$ and binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{i}$, where $n$ is an integer. The theorem or claim to prove is that this sum is an integer for all integers $n$, given that the coefficients $a_i$ are integers.

To prove this claim, we can invoke the properties of binomial coefficients and some elementary number theory.

Let us consider the sum:

$$ S(n) = a_0 \binom{n}{0} + a_1 \binom{n}{1} + \ldots + a_k \binom{n}{k} $$

where $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k$ are integers, and $k \leq n$.

Given that:

$$ \binom{n}{i} = \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} $$

For each $i = 0, 1, \ldots, k$, the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{i}$ is an integer because:

- $n!$ is the product of all positive integers from $1$ to $n$, which is an integer.
- $i!(n-i)!$ is the product of all positive integers from $1$ to $i$ and from $1$ to $(n-i)$, respectively, both of which are integers. Since $i$ and $(n-i)$ are less than or equal to $n$, $i!(n-i)!$ divides $n!$ without remainder.

Thus, the product $a_i \binom{n}{i}$ is an integer since it is the product of two integers. The sum of integers is also an integer, so $S(n)$ is an integer for any integer $n$.

This proof hinges on the fundamental property that binomial coefficients are integers, which follows from the definition of the factorial and the division of factorials as described in the binomial coefficient formula. If $n$ is negative or if $k > n$, the binomial coefficient is defined to be zero, and thus the sum would still be an integer as it would involve terms that are zero.

This is a general proof, and it holds regardless of the specific values of $a_i$ as long as they are integers. If you have a specific set of coefficients or further conditions, please provide them, and we can delve into a more tailored proof.

# Proof of the sum of n natural numbers using binomial coefficients
To prove the closed form solution for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers using Pascal's triangle and binomial coefficients, we'll embark on a journey through a blend of combinatorial reasoning and algebraic manipulation.

Let's consider the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, which can be represented as $S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n$. Our goal is to express this sum in a closed form.

The key insight comes from observing Pascal's triangle and the binomial coefficients. In Pascal's triangle, each entry is the sum of the two entries directly above it. The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ represents the entry in the $n$-th row and $k$-th column of Pascal's triangle, and it can be computed as:

$$ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$

Now, let's make an intriguing connection: each natural number $k$ in our sum $S$ can be linked to the binomial coefficient $\binom{k+1}{2}$. This is because $\binom{k+1}{2}$ counts the number of ways to choose $2$ elements out of $(k+1)$, which essentially adds up to $k$.

Thus, our sum $S$ can be re-written in terms of binomial coefficients as:

$$ S = \binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n+1}{2} $$

Now, a beautiful property of binomial coefficients comes into play. The sum of binomial coefficients across a diagonal in Pascal's triangle is equal to a binomial coefficient from the next row. Specifically:

$$ \binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n+1}{2} = \binom{n+2}{3} $$

Using the formula for binomial coefficients, we find:

$$ \binom{n+2}{3} = \frac{(n+2)!}{3!(n-1)!} = \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n}{3 \times 2 \times 1} $$

Simplifying this, we obtain the closed-form expression for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers:

$$ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$

Thus, through a blend of combinatorial insights and algebraic manipulations, we have elegantly arrived at the well-known formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, showcasing the profound connections between different areas of mathematics.

# Proof of the sum of n natural numbers using binomial coefficients

To derive the closed-form expression for the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers using Pascal's Triangle and binomial coefficients, we'll delve into an elegant blend of combinatorial logic and algebraic prowess.

Consider the sum of squares $S = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2$. Our aim is to express $S$ in a succinct, closed form.

Let's recall the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ and its representation in Pascal's Triangle. Each entry in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two entries directly above it. The binomial coefficient is defined as:

$$ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$

Now, let's establish a connection between the square of each natural number $k$ in our sum $S$ and a particular binomial coefficient. Interestingly, the square of $k$, denoted $k^2$, is closely related to the binomial coefficient $\binom{k+2}{3}$.

Thus, we can express our sum $S$ in terms of these binomial coefficients:

$$ S = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \ldots + \binom{n+2}{3} $$

We leverage a significant property of binomial coefficients: the sum of coefficients along a diagonal in Pascal's Triangle equals a coefficient from the subsequent row. Specifically, this property manifests here as:

$$ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \ldots + \binom{n+2}{3} = \binom{n+3}{4} $$

By applying the formula for binomial coefficients, we compute:

$$ \binom{n+3}{4} = \frac{(n+3)!}{4!(n-1)!} = \frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)n}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $$

Simplifying this expression, we reach the elegant closed-form formula for the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers:

$$ S = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$

In this manner, through a fusion of combinatorial insights and algebraic manipulation, we beautifully derive the classic formula for the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers, illustrating the deep interconnections within the realm of mathematics.

# A slightly more elaborate proof
To delve into a more elaborate proof for the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers using Pascal's Triangle and binomial coefficients, we will navigate through a more intricate combinatorial reasoning and algebraic exploration.

### Sum of Squares

We aim to find a closed-form expression for $S = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2$. This sum can be approached by linking it with binomial coefficients.

### Binomial Coefficients and Pascal's Triangle

The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is defined as:

$$ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$

In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the two directly above it. This triangular array elegantly encodes combinatorial coefficients.

### Connection to Squares

We seek a binomial coefficient representation that parallels $k^2$. The link can be found in the identity:

$$ k^3 = 6\binom{k+2}{3} + 6\binom{k+1}{2} + \binom{k}{1} $$

The sum of cubes is not our direct interest, but this identity will lead us to the sum of squares. To see how, consider the sum of the first $n$ cubes:

$$ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 $$

Using the aforementioned identity, this becomes:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{n} (6\binom{k+2}{3} + 6\binom{k+1}{2} + \binom{k}{1}) $$

### Telescoping Property

A crucial step is the use of the telescoping property in the sums. Notice how certain sums of binomial coefficients can be simplified using the properties of Pascal's Triangle. Specifically, the sum over the diagonals in Pascal's Triangle gives a binomial coefficient from the next row.

### Algebraic Manipulation

Now, we expand and rearrange the terms:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6\binom{k+2}{3} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6\binom{k+1}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{k}{1} $$

Using the telescoping property and simplifying, we obtain expressions for each of these sums. Notably, the sum of cubes ($\sum k^3$) can be expressed in terms of these binomial sums. 

### Relating to Sum of Squares

By carefully examining the relationship between the sum of cubes and the sum of squares, we can extract an expression for the sum of squares. This involves algebraic manipulation and solving for the sum of squares in terms of known quantities.

### Final Expression

After the algebraic journey, we find that:

$$ S = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$

### Conclusion

This proof, while more elaborate, underscores the power of combinatorial reasoning in deriving algebraic formulas. The sum of squares, a seemingly straightforward arithmetic sequence, is unveiled through the lens of binomial coefficients and Pascal's Triangle, revealing the profound interconnectedness in mathematics.

# More about the Algebraic Manipulations underneath

### Sum of Cubes and Binomial Coefficients

From the identity we have:

$$ k^3 = 6\binom{k+2}{3} + 6\binom{k+1}{2} + \binom{k}{1} $$

Summing this for $k$ from $1$ to $n$, we get:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6\binom{k+2}{3} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6\binom{k+1}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{k}{1} $$

### Telescoping Sums

The sums of binomial coefficients can be simplified using the telescoping property. Consider the sum of the first $n$ terms of each binomial coefficient series:

1. **Sum of $\binom{k+2}{3}$**: The sum $\sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{k+2}{3}$ telescopes to $\binom{n+3}{4}$ due to the properties of Pascal's Triangle.
   
2. **Sum of $\binom{k+1}{2}$**: Similarly, $\sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{k+1}{2}$ telescopes to $\binom{n+2}{3}$.
   
3. **Sum of $\binom{k}{1}$**: This is straightforward, as $\binom{k}{1} = k$, so the sum is simply the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, which is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

### Expressing Sum of Cubes

We know the sum of cubes is equal to the square of the sum of first $n$ natural numbers:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n} k \right)^2 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 $$

### Connecting to Sum of Squares

Now, we plug in the expressions for the telescoping sums into our initial sum of cubes:

$$ \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 = 6\binom{n+3}{4} + 6\binom{n+2}{3} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$

We can express the binomial coefficients in their expanded form:

1. $ \binom{n+3}{4} = \frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)n}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $
2. $ \binom{n+2}{3} = \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n}{3 \times 2 \times 1} $

Substitute these back into the equation:

$$ \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 = 6 \times \frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)n}{24} + 6 \times \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n}{6} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$

### Algebraic Manipulation

We then proceed with algebraic manipulation, which involves expanding, simplifying, and rearranging terms to isolate the sum of squares term ($S = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2$) on one side of the equation.

This manipulation is somewhat involved, requiring careful handling of the algebraic terms. The goal is to express all terms in a form that allows us to solve for $S$.

### Final Expression for Sum of Squares

After performing these algebraic manipulations, we arrive at the well-known formula for the sum of squares:

$$ S = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$

This formula encapsulates the sum of the squares of the first $n$ natural numbers, elegantly derived through a blend of combinatorial reasoning and algebraic finesse.

# Alternating Sums of the Rows of Pascal's Triangle, Proof
To explore the alternating row sums of Pascal's Triangle, we'll begin by defining Pascal's Triangle and the concept of alternating row sums. We'll then delve into a combinatorial proof, blending rigorous mathematical reasoning with a touch of poetic eloquence.

### Pascal's Triangle and Alternating Row Sums

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. The $n$th row (starting with $n = 0$ at the top) contains the coefficients of the expansion of $(x + y)^n$. For instance, the third row, corresponding to $(x + y)^3$, is $1, 3, 3, 1$.

The **alternating row sum** for the $n$th row is the sum of the elements of that row, where each element is alternately added and subtracted. Formally, for the $n$th row, it is represented as:
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \binom{n}{k}
$$

### Combinatorial Proof

Now, let's provide a combinatorial proof. We'll interpret the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ as the number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$ items. The sign $(-1)^k$ switches between addition and subtraction.

Consider a set $S$ of $n$ distinct items. We are interested in counting the number of ways to choose a subset of $S$ (including the empty set and $S$ itself), considering the alternating signs.

1. **Odd and Even Subsets**: Divide the subsets of $S$ into two groups: those with an even number of elements and those with an odd number. $\binom{n}{k}$ counts the number of $k$-element subsets. For even $k$, we add this count, and for odd $k$, we subtract it.

2. **Pairing Method**: Each odd-sized subset can be paired with an even-sized subset by either adding or removing a particular element. This creates a one-to-one correspondence between the sets of odd and even cardinality, except for the empty set, which stands alone.

3. **Net Counting**: Since every odd-sized subset is canceled out by its even-sized counterpart, the only unpaired set is the empty set, which contributes $1$ to the sum. Therefore, the alternating sum gives us:
   $$
   \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} = 0
   $$
   for all $n \gt 1$.

This combinatorial approach illustrates the elegant symmetry inherent in Pascal's Triangle. Each term in the sum represents a subset of $S$, and the alternating signs reflect the interplay between the parity of subset sizes. The result that this sum equals $1$ (except for $n = 0$, where it's $0$) mirrors the subtle balance between the multitude of subsets, aligning perfectly with the harmonious nature of mathematical structures.

# Properties of Binomial Coefficients
Binomial coefficients, denoted as $\binom{n}{k}$, have several crucial properties that are fundamental in combinatorics, algebra, and calculus. Here are some of the most important properties, along with a brief approach to their proofs:

1. **Symmetry Property**: 
   $$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$$
   This property reflects the idea that choosing $k$ items out of $n$ is the same as choosing the $n-k$ items to leave out. A proof can be approached by directly manipulating the factorial definition of binomial coefficients.

2. **Pascal's Identity**: 
   $$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$$
   This property is central in constructing Pascal's Triangle, a geometric representation of binomial coefficients. The proof typically involves algebraic manipulation of the factorial formula of binomial coefficients.

3. **Summation Property**:
   $$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$$
   This states that the sum of the binomial coefficients of a given $n$ is $2^n$. The proof often involves the Binomial Theorem, considering the expansion of $(1+1)^n$.

4. **Binomial Theorem**:
   For any integer $n \geq 0$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$:
   $$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k$$
   This theorem provides a formula for the expansion of powers of a binomial. A combinatorial proof of this can be made by considering the different ways to form terms in the expansion.

5. **Product Formula**:
   $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
   This is the definition of a binomial coefficient, often used as a starting point for other proofs. It's derived from the number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$ without regard to order.

6. **Recurrence Relation**:
   $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n-k+1}{k} \binom{n}{k-1}$$
   This property is useful in iterative calculations of binomial coefficients. It can be proven by manipulating the product formula.

7. **Vandermonde's Identity**:
   $$\binom{m+n}{r} = \sum_{k=0}^{r} \binom{m}{k}\binom{n}{r-k}$$
   This identity is crucial in various combinatorial proofs and can be proven using a double counting argument or generating functions.

8. **Upper Negation Formula**:
   $$\binom{-n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{n+k-1}{k}$$
   This property extends binomial coefficients to negative integers and is proved using the Gamma function or by algebraic manipulation of the binomial coefficient formula.

Each of these properties can be explored in much more depth, involving elegant and insightful mathematical arguments that blend combinatorial reasoning with algebraic manipulation.

# Number of Taxicab Paths Proof
The concept of "taxicab paths" often refers to a problem in combinatorics, specifically related to lattice paths in a grid. In a standard setting, it involves counting the number of shortest paths from one corner of a grid to another, typically moving only right or up. This is a classic problem in combinatorics, illustrating fundamental principles in counting and discrete mathematics.

Consider a grid of size $m \times n$. To move from the bottom-left corner (0,0) to the top-right corner $(m, n)$, one must move $m$ steps to the right and $n$ steps up, in any order. Each path can be represented as a sequence of rights (R) and ups (U). For instance, a path in a $2 \times 2$ grid could be "RURU" or "URRU".

The number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{m+n}{n}$, which represents the number of ways to choose $n$ ups (or equivalently $m$ rights) out of the $m+n$ total steps. This is because choosing when to go up (or right) uniquely determines a path. The formula for the binomial coefficient is:

$$
\binom{m+n}{n} = \frac{(m+n)!}{m! \, n!}
$$

### Proof:

1. **Total steps**: Any path from $(0,0)$ to $(m, n)$ consists of $m + n$ steps.
   
2. **Indistinguishability of Steps**: Among these $m + n$ steps, $m$ are in the right direction and $n$ are in the up direction. These steps are indistinguishable among themselves (all rights are the same, and all ups are the same).

3. **Combination Formula**: The number of ways to arrange these steps, where order matters but we cannot distinguish between rights and ups, is given by the combination formula, which compensates for the indistinguishability:

   $$
   \frac{(m+n)!}{m! \, n!}
   $$

   Here, $(m+n)!$ counts all the permutations (arrangements where order matters) of the $m + n$ steps. Since within these steps, $m$ rights are indistinguishable among themselves, we divide by $m!$. Similarly, we divide by $n!$ for the $n$ indistinguishable up steps.

### Example:

In a $2 \times 3$ grid, the number of shortest paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2,3)$ is:

$$
\binom{2+3}{2} = \frac{5!}{2! \, 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10
$$

So, there are 10 distinct shortest paths in this case.

The problem of dividing 100 coins among 5 pirates can be approached using a combinatorial method known as the "stars and bars" technique. This method is used in combinatorics to solve problems of distributing indistinguishable objects (coins, in this case) into distinguishable bins (the pirates). The key idea is to represent the distribution as a sequence of coins (stars) and dividers (bars) that separate the coins into different groups.

### The Problem:

- We have 100 indistinguishable coins.
- We want to distribute these coins among 5 distinguishable pirates.
- A pirate can receive any number of coins, including zero.

### Stars and Bars Method:

1. **Representation**: Imagine representing the 100 coins as 100 stars (⭐). We need to place 4 bars (|) to create 5 sections, each representing the number of coins a pirate receives.

2. **Example Representation**: 
   
   ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   
   This represents a distribution where the first pirate gets 3 coins, the second gets 5, the third gets 1, the fourth gets 9, and the fifth gets 4.

3. **Counting the Distributions**: The total number of distributions is the number of ways to arrange these 100 stars and 4 bars in a sequence. This is a combinatorial problem where we choose 4 positions for the bars out of 104 positions (100 stars + 4 bars).

### The Formula:

The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 104 is given by the binomial coefficient:

$$
\binom{104}{4} = \frac{104!}{4! \, (104 - 4)!}
$$

### Proof:

1. **Total Positions**: There are 104 positions in total (100 coins and 4 dividers).

2. **Indistinguishability of Objects**: The coins are indistinguishable, and so are the dividers.

3. **Combination Formula**: The number of ways to arrange these objects, accounting for their indistinguishability, is given by the combination formula:

   $$
   \binom{104}{4} = \frac{104!}{4! \, 100!}
   $$

   Here, $104!$ counts all permutations of 104 objects. Since within these objects, 4 are dividers and are indistinguishable among themselves, we divide by $4!$. The rest are coins, so we divide by $100!$ to account for their indistinguishability.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute 100 indistinguishable coins among 5 distinguishable pirates is $\binom{104}{4}$.
