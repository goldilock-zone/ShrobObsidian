Thank you for the clarification. I'll ensure the mathematical expressions are enclosed in double dollar signs and placed on separate lines, as per the specified format:

- **Geometric Lattices**
  1. Problem: Given a set of vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), where
     $$
     v_1 = (1,0,0), v_2 = (0,1,0), \text{ and } v_3 = (1,1,1),
     $$
     find the set of points that form the lattice generated by these vectors.
     Hint: Use the definition of a lattice in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) to express each point in the lattice as a linear combination of the given vectors with integer coefficients.

- **Algebraic Lattices (Order Theory)**
  2. Problem: Consider a poset \( P \) consisting of the set \( \{a, b, c, d\} \) with the ordering relations:
     $$
     a \leq b, a \leq c, b \leq d, \text{ and } c \leq d.
     $$
     Draw the Hasse diagram for this poset and determine if this structure forms a lattice.
     Hint: Every pair of elements in \( P \) must have a unique supremum (join) and infimum (meet) for it to form a lattice.

- **Isoclines**
  3. Problem: For the differential equation
     $$
     y' = xy,
     $$
     find the equation of the isocline for a slope of \( k = 2 \).
     Hint: Set the differential equation equal to \( k \) and solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \).

- **Slope Fields**
  4. Problem: Sketch the slope field for the differential equation
     $$
     y' = -y.
     $$
     Describe the general behavior of the solution curves.
     Hint: Draw short line segments with slope \( -y \) at each point \( (x, y) \).

- **Autonomous Differential Equations**
  5. Problem: Determine the equilibrium points for the autonomous differential equation
     $$
     \frac{dy}{dt} = y(1 - y)
     $$
     and classify them as stable or unstable.
     Hint: Find where \( \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \) and analyze the sign of \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) around these points.

- **Mixed Concepts**
  6. Problem: Consider a three-dimensional cubic lattice. If a unit cell of this lattice is a cube with side length 1, calculate the volume of the unit cell.
     Hint: The volume of a cube is the cube of its side length.

  7. Problem: For the poset \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\} \) with the divisibility relation, draw the Hasse diagram and identify the greatest and least elements, if they exist.
     Hint: The divisibility relation is antisymmetric and transitive.

  8. Problem: Find the isocline for the slope \( k = 0 \) in the differential equation
     $$
     y' = \sin(x) - y.
     $$
     Hint: Set \( y' = 0 \) and solve for \( y \).

  9. Problem: Sketch the slope field for the differential equation
     $$
     y' = \cos(y)
     $$
     and describe the general behavior near \( y = \frac{\pi}{2} \).
     Hint: Consider the value of \( \cos(y) \) at and near \( y = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

  10. Problem: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium point \( y = 0 \) for the autonomous equation
      $$
      \frac{dy}{dt} = \sin(y).
      $$
      Hint: Investigate the behavior of \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) near \( y = 0 \).
