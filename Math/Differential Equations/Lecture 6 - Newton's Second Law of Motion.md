Newton's Second Law of Motion forms the basis of many differential equations, particularly in dynamics. When considering falling objects with air resistance, the law is applied to derive a differential equation that models the motion of the object under the influence of gravity and the resisting force of air.

### Newton's Second Law of Motion:

Newton's Second Law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration:

$$
F = ma
$$

For a falling object, two primary forces are at play:

1. **Gravitational Force:** \( F_g = mg \), where \( m \) is the mass of the object and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. **Air Resistance:** Often modeled as proportional to the velocity of the object, \( F_r = kv \), where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality and \( v \) is the velocity.

### Differential Equation for Falling Objects with Air Resistance:

The net force acting on the object is the difference between the gravitational force and the air resistance. According to Newton's Second Law:

$$
F_{\text{net}} = F_g - F_r = mg - kv
$$

Since \( F_{\text{net}} = ma \) and \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \) (acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time), we have:

$$
mg - kv = m \frac{dv}{dt}
$$

This leads to the differential equation:

$$
m \frac{dv}{dt} + kv = mg
$$

### Solving the Differential Equation:

To solve this equation, we can use the method of integrating factors or separation of variables, depending on the specific nature of \( k \) and \( m \). Generally, this equation is a first-order linear ODE.

### Example: Falling Object with Linear Air Resistance

Consider a specific case where \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( k = 0.1 \, \text{kg/s} \), with an initial condition \( v(0) = 0 \) (the object starts from rest).

The differential equation becomes:

$$
\frac{dv}{dt} + 0.1v = 9.8
$$

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Solve the ODE:** We can use an integrating factor or other appropriate methods to solve this first-order linear differential equation.

2. **Apply the Initial Condition:** The initial condition \( v(0) = 0 \) is used to find the specific value of the integration constant, yielding the particular solution that describes the velocity of the object as a function of time under the influence of gravity and air resistance.

This example demonstrates how Newton's Second Law, combined with considerations of external forces like air resistance, leads to a differential equation that can be solved to predict the motion of falling objects in a realistic physical context.

- Aside: Using Integrating Factor
The integrating factor method is a powerful technique for solving linear first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
$$

Here, \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are functions of \(x\). The method involves multiplying the entire equation by an integrating factor that is specifically chosen to simplify the process of integration. The integrating factor, \( \mu(x) \), is defined as:

$$
\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) \, dx}
$$

### Steps to Solve Using the Integrating Factor Method:

1. **Calculate the Integrating Factor:** Compute \( \mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) \, dx} \). This step does not require determining the constant of integration.

2. **Multiply the ODE by the Integrating Factor:** Multiply every term in the ODE by \( \mu(x) \):

   $$
   \mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)P(x)y = \mu(x)Q(x)
   $$

   The left-hand side of this equation is now the derivative of a product:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)y] = \mu(x)Q(x)
   $$

3. **Integrate Both Sides:** Integrate both sides with respect to \(x\):

   $$
   \int \frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)y] \, dx = \int \mu(x)Q(x) \, dx
   $$

   This simplifies to:

   $$
   \mu(x)y = \int \mu(x)Q(x) \, dx + C
   $$

   where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

4. **Solve for \(y\):** Finally, solve for \(y\) to obtain the general solution:

   $$
   y = \frac{1}{\mu(x)} \left( \int \mu(x)Q(x) \, dx + C \right)
   $$

### Example:

Consider the differential equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + 2xy = x
$$

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Integrating Factor:** Calculate \( \mu(x) = e^{\int 2x \, dx} = e^{x^2} \).

2. **Multiply the ODE:** Multiply every term by \( e^{x^2} \):

   $$
   e^{x^2}\frac{dy}{dx} + 2xe^{x^2}y = xe^{x^2}
   $$

   Which simplifies to:

   $$
   \frac{d}{dx}[e^{x^2}y] = xe^{x^2}
   $$

3. **Integrate Both Sides:**

   $$
   e^{x^2}y = \int xe^{x^2} \, dx + C
   $$

   Using integration by substitution, we find:

   $$
   e^{x^2}y = \frac{1}{2}e^{x^2} + C
   $$

4. **Solve for \(y\):**

   $$
   y = \frac{1}{2} + Ce^{-x^2}
   $$

This method is particularly useful for linear first-order ODEs, providing a systematic approach to finding their general solutions.
