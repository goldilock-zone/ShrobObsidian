**Differential Equations and Exponential Growth/Decay Worksheet**

1. Solve the following first-order differential equation:
   $$ \frac{dy}{dt} = 3y + 2 $$
   
2. Find the solution to the differential equation:
   $$ \frac{dy}{dt} = 2ty $$
   
3. Solve the initial value problem:
   $$ \frac{dy}{dt} = -0.1y, \quad y(0) = 1000 $$
   
4. Determine the solution to the differential equation:
   $$ \frac{dy}{dt} = -ky, \quad y(0) = 2000 $$
   where \( k \) is a positive constant.

5. Solve the following differential equation for population growth:
   $$ \frac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P\left(1 - \frac{P}{5000}\right) $$

6. Find the general solution to the logistic differential equation:
   $$ \frac{dN}{dt} = 0.02N\left(1 - \frac{N}{1000}\right) $$

7. Solve the initial value problem for the logistic equation:
   $$ \frac{dN}{dt} = 0.03N\left(1 - \frac{N}{1500}\right), \quad N(0) = 200 $$

8. A bank offers an annual interest rate of 8%. Calculate the time it takes for a $10,000 investment to double in value if interest is compounded continuously.

9. A radioactive substance has a half-life of 30 days. Calculate the rate of decay for this substance if there are initially 1000 grams.

10. A population of rabbits exhibits logistic growth with a carrying capacity of 5000. If the initial population is 100 and the growth rate is 0.05 per year, find the population after 10 years.
