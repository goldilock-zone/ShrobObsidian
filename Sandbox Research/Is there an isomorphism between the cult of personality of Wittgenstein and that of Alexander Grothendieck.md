Comparing the "cult of personality" around Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alexander Grothendieck is an interesting exercise, but it's important to note that any such comparison would be somewhat subjective and open to interpretation. Both Wittgenstein and Grothendieck were influential figures in their respective fields (philosophy and mathematics), and they had a significant impact on the way their disciplines were practiced and understood. However, the nature of their influence and the way their personalities were perceived by others can vary.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Influence on Their Fields:** Wittgenstein and Grothendieck both made groundbreaking contributions to their fields. Wittgenstein's work in philosophy, especially his early work in the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" and later work in "Philosophical Investigations," had a profound influence on the development of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language. Grothendieck's work in mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry and category theory, reshaped and revitalized those areas of mathematics.

2. **Reclusiveness:** Both Wittgenstein and Grothendieck were known for their reclusive and enigmatic personalities. Wittgenstein was often reclusive and introspective, and he had a reputation for being intense and difficult to understand. Grothendieck famously withdrew from the mathematical community later in his life, living in seclusion and distancing himself from academia.

3. **Controversy:** Wittgenstein and Grothendieck were not without controversy. Wittgenstein's ideas and methods in philosophy sparked heated debates and discussions. Grothendieck's outspoken political and social views, as well as his unconventional approach to mathematics, led to disagreements within the mathematical community.

4. **Devotees and Followers:** Both Wittgenstein and Grothendieck had devoted followers who admired their work and philosophies. In some cases, these followers may have developed a "cult of personality" around them, attributing almost mythical qualities to their heroes.

5. **Impact on Future Generations:** The influence of Wittgenstein and Grothendieck extended beyond their lifetimes, as their ideas and methods continued to shape their respective fields and inspire subsequent generations of thinkers and mathematicians.

However, it's essential to recognize that the term "cult of personality" typically carries a negative connotation, suggesting an excessive or blind admiration of an individual to the point where their ideas and actions are unquestioningly accepted. While both Wittgenstein and Grothendieck had admirers, it's not clear that either of them had a cult of personality in the way that, for example, political leaders or pop culture icons might have.

In summary, there are similarities in the influence, reclusiveness, and controversies surrounding Wittgenstein and Grothendieck, but whether one would describe either of them as having a "cult of personality" depends on one's perspective and interpretation of their lives and work.
