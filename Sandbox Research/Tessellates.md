To tessellate means to cover a surface or plane completely with a repeated pattern of geometric shapes or tiles without any gaps or overlaps. Tessellations are a form of mathematical and artistic patterns that have been used in various cultures and art forms throughout history. Here are some key points about tessellations:

1. **Geometric Shapes**: Tessellations are typically created using geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, hexagons, and other polygons. These shapes are repeated in a way that they fit together perfectly, covering the entire surface.

2. **No Gaps or Overlaps**: One of the fundamental rules of tessellation is that there should be no gaps (empty spaces) or overlaps between the shapes. This means that the shapes must fit together seamlessly.

3. **Regular and Irregular Tessellations**: Tessellations can be categorized into two main types: regular and irregular tessellations.
   - **Regular Tessellations**: In a regular tessellation, the same regular polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, or hexagon) is used to completely cover the plane. Regular tessellations are also known as periodic tessellations.
   - **Irregular Tessellations**: In an irregular tessellation, different types of polygons or shapes are combined to cover the plane. Irregular tessellations are often more complex and less symmetrical than regular tessellations.

4. **Escher Tessellations**: The Dutch artist M.C. Escher is famous for his intricate and mind-bending tessellations, where he combined various shapes and transformed them into complex patterns that seem to defy the laws of geometry and perspective. His tessellations often feature optical illusions.

5. **Mathematical Study**: Tessellations are not only an artistic pursuit but also a subject of mathematical study. Mathematicians have explored the properties and symmetries of tessellations and have developed mathematical frameworks to understand and create them.

6. **Applications**: Tessellations can be found in various aspects of art, architecture, and design. They are used in decorative tiling, mosaic artwork, architectural patterns, and even in computer graphics and game design.

Tessellations offer a fascinating intersection of mathematics and art, and they provide endless opportunities for creativity and exploration. Artists, mathematicians, and designers continue to be inspired by tessellations, creating unique and visually appealing patterns that captivate the imagination.
