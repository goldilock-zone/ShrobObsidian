"Self-subsistent reality" refers to a concept often used in philosophy and theology to describe a state of existence in which something is self-sustaining and self-contained, not dependent on anything external for its existence or attributes. It implies that the entity or reality in question possesses a kind of self-sufficiency and does not rely on any external factors or causes to maintain its existence or properties.

In philosophical and theological discussions, the term "self-subsistent reality" is often associated with the concept of God or the ultimate ground of being in certain religious traditions. According to these views, God is considered a self-subsistent reality because, by definition, God is believed to be independent, eternal, and uncaused, requiring no external source or condition for existence.

The concept of self-subsistence is also relevant in metaphysical discussions about the nature of reality and existence. It can be contrasted with contingent existence, where something's existence depends on other factors or causes. Self-subsistent reality is often used as a foundational concept in arguments for the existence of a necessary being or a prime mover in philosophical and theological contexts.

Overall, "self-subsistent reality" is a term that points to a state of self-contained existence, often used in discussions related to the nature of divinity and the fundamental principles of reality.
