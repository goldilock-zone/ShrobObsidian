Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy underwent significant developments throughout his career, leading to a distinction between his early and later philosophies. Here are some key differences between early and later Wittgenstein:

**Early Wittgenstein (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus):**

1. **Logical Atomism:** In his early work, Wittgenstein espoused a view known as logical atomism. He believed that language and thought could be broken down into simple, atomic propositions that corresponded to reality. The world, according to the Tractatus, consists of facts composed of simple objects combined through atomic propositions.

2. **Picture Theory of Language:** Wittgenstein introduced the "picture theory of language," which asserted that meaningful language mirrors the structure of reality. In this view, meaningful propositions are isomorphic to states of affairs in the world.

3. **The Limit of Language:** Wittgenstein argued that there are limits to what can be said or meaningfully talked about. He famously concluded the Tractatus with the statement, "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." He believed that metaphysical or nonsensical statements should be discarded.

4. **Emphasis on Precision:** The Tractatus emphasizes the need for precision and clarity in language and thought. Wittgenstein held that philosophical problems arise from misunderstandings of language and the improper use of concepts.

**Later Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations):**

1. **Language Games:** In his later work, as presented in "Philosophical Investigations," Wittgenstein introduced the concept of "language games." He shifted away from the idea of a single, unified language that mirrors reality. Instead, he described various language games, each with its own set of rules and purposes.

2. **Use of Language:** Wittgenstein argued that the meaning of language is rooted in its use within specific social practices. Language is not a reflection of a fixed reality but a dynamic, evolving tool used by communities of language users.

3. **Contextual Meaning:** He emphasized the importance of context in understanding the meaning of words and expressions. Words derive their meaning from the context in which they are used and from the language games being played.

4. **Resistance to Philosophical Systems:** Wittgenstein rejected the idea of constructing comprehensive philosophical systems or theories. Instead, he encouraged philosophers to engage in detailed examinations of specific language games and linguistic practices.

5. **Open-Ended Philosophy:** Wittgenstein's later philosophy is characterized by a more open-ended and therapeutic approach. Rather than providing definitive answers to philosophical problems, he aimed to dissolve philosophical confusions by examining the ways in which language is actually used.

In summary, the early Wittgenstein, as seen in the "Tractatus," sought to establish a precise and systematic account of language and reality. The later Wittgenstein, in "Philosophical Investigations," shifted his focus to the pragmatic and contextual nature of language, emphasizing language games, the diversity of language uses, and the importance of understanding how language functions in practice. These shifts in emphasis and approach mark the key differences between his early and later philosophies.
