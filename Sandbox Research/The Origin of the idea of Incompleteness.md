The concept of completeness in formal logic was developed by the German mathematician and philosopher David Hilbert in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to Kurt Gödel's groundbreaking work. Hilbert's contributions to the field of mathematical logic, including the idea of completeness, were significant in the development of the foundations of mathematics.

In 1920, David Hilbert published his famous list of 23 unsolved problems in mathematics, known as "Hilbert's Problems," and the second problem on his list was related to the completeness of formal systems. He was concerned with whether it was possible to provide a complete set of axioms and rules for all of mathematics, thereby ensuring that every mathematical statement could be proven or disproven within this formal system.

Hilbert's work on completeness led to the development of what is known as "[[Hilbert's Program]]," which aimed to formalize mathematics on a secure and complete foundation. However, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, published in the early 1930s, had a profound impact on Hilbert's Program. Gödel showed that there are inherent limitations to the completeness and consistency of formal mathematical systems, and that it was impossible to achieve Hilbert's goal using the methods that Hilbert had envisioned.

In summary, David Hilbert was the mathematician who first brought forth the idea of completeness in formal systems, as part of his broader efforts to establish a complete and consistent foundation for all of mathematics. Gödel's incompleteness theorems later demonstrated the limitations of achieving this goal.
