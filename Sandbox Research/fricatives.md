In phonetics, a fricative is a pulmonic consonant sound produced by constricting the vocal tract in such a way that the airstream produces audible friction. Fricatives are typically produced with the tongue, lips, or velum, and they are often described as being "hissing" or "hushing" sounds.

Fricatives are common sounds in all languages, and they can be found in all positions in a word. Examples of fricatives in English include the sounds /f/, /v/, /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, and /h/.

Here is a table of the nine fricatives in English:

|Fricative|IPA Symbol|Description|
|---|---|---|
|voiceless labiodental fricative|/f/|Produced by placing the lower lip against the upper teeth|
|voiced labiodental fricative|/v/|Produced by placing the lower lip against the upper teeth and vibrating the vocal cords|
|voiceless dental fricative|/θ/|Produced by placing the tongue tip against the upper teeth|
|voiced dental fricative|/ð/|Produced by placing the tongue tip against the upper teeth and vibrating the vocal cords|
|voiceless alveolar fricative|/s/|Produced by placing the tongue tip against the alveolar ridge|
|voiced alveolar fricative|/z/|Produced by placing the tongue tip against the alveolar ridge and vibrating the vocal cords|
|voiceless postalveolar fricative|/ʃ/|Produced by raising the tongue tip and blade towards the alveolar ridge|
|voiced postalveolar fricative|/ʒ/|Produced by raising the tongue tip and blade towards the alveolar ridge and vibrating the vocal cords|
|voiceless glottal fricative|/h/|Produced by constricting the glottis|

Fricatives can be classified according to their place of articulation, their voicing, and their manner of articulation.

- **Place of articulation** refers to the point in the vocal tract where the constriction is made. Fricatives can be produced in the following places of articulation:
    
    - bilabial: the lips
    - labiodental: the lower lip and upper teeth
    - dental: the tongue tip and upper teeth
    - alveolar: the tongue tip and the alveolar ridge
    - postalveolar: the tongue tip and blade and the alveolar ridge
    - palatal: the tongue front and the hard palate
    - velar: the tongue back and the velum
    - uvular: the tongue back and the uvula
    
- **Voicing** refers to whether or not the vocal cords vibrate. Fricatives can be either voiced or voiceless. Voiced fricatives are produced with vibrating vocal cords, while voiceless fricatives are produced without vibrating vocal cords.
    
- **Manner of articulation** refers to the type of constriction that is made. Fricatives can be either fricatives or affricates. Fricatives are produced with a continuous stream of air that is obstructed by the articulators. Affricates are produced with a brief closure of the articulators, followed by a fricative release.
    

Fricatives are an important part of the sound system of many languages. They can be used to distinguish between words, to convey meaning, and to add variety to speech.
