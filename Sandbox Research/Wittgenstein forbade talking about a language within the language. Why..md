Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly in his later philosophy as expressed in "Philosophical Investigations," had strong reservations about the idea of talking about language within the language itself. This perspective is closely related to his views on the limitations of language and the nature of meaning. Here's why Wittgenstein held this position:

1. **The Private Language Argument:** Wittgenstein's famous "private language argument" is a central part of his philosophy and contributes to his stance against talking about language within the language. He argued that the very concept of a private language, a language known only to the individual speaker and not sharable with others, is incoherent. Wittgenstein challenged the idea that one could have a set of private, inner experiences that correspond to unique words or symbols in a language. Without a shared, public criterion for the meaning of words, language would lose its capacity to communicate.

2. **Language is a Social Practice:** Wittgenstein emphasized that language is fundamentally a social practice. The meaning of words and symbols arises from their use in a community of language users. To understand a language, one must engage in the linguistic practices of that community. Language isn't a private, individual invention; it's a shared, cultural phenomenon.

3. **Rule-Following and Community Standards:** Wittgenstein's philosophy explores the idea of rule-following and the role of community standards in language. According to him, understanding the meaning of a word or following a rule isn't a matter of referring to inner mental states but of conforming to communal practices and norms. When we use language, we are guided by the rules and conventions of the language community.

4. **Avoiding Philosophical Confusions:** Wittgenstein was concerned with the way certain philosophical problems and confusions arise when philosophers treat language as if it were a self-contained, perfectly logical system. Talking about language within the language can lead to paradoxes and misunderstandings because it ignores the contextual and pragmatic aspects of language use.

In summary, Wittgenstein's prohibition on talking about language within the language was motivated by his views on the inherently social and communal nature of language, the problems associated with private languages, and the need to avoid philosophical confusions that arise when language is treated as a self-contained system. His philosophy encourages a shift in focus from abstract theorizing about language to an examination of how language functions in everyday, practical contexts within communities of users.
