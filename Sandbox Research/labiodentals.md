Labiodentals are consonants that are produced by obstructing the airflow with the lower lip against the upper teeth. The two most common labiodental consonants are /f/ and /v/.

- **The voiceless labiodental fricative /f/** is produced by bringing the lower lip against the upper teeth and blowing air through the narrow opening that is created between them. The sound is similar to the "f" in "fan".
    
- **The voiced labiodental fricative /v/** is produced by bringing the lower lip against the upper teeth and blowing air through the narrow opening that is created between them while vibrating the vocal cords. The sound is similar to the "v" in "van".
    

Labiodental consonants are found in many languages around the world. In English, they are relatively common consonants, and they can occur in all positions in a word. For example, the /f/ sound occurs at the beginning of the word "fan", at the end of the word "safe", and in the middle of the word "sofa". The /v/ sound occurs at the beginning of the word "van", at the end of the word "love", and in the middle of the word "live".

Labiodental consonants are produced by a combination of the lips and the teeth. The lips are used to create the constriction that obstructs the airflow, and the teeth are used to provide a hard surface against which the lips can vibrate. This combination of articulators results in a sound that is characterized by its high-frequency energy and its lack of aspiration.

Labiodental consonants are often used to distinguish between words. For example, the English words "fan" and "van" are distinguished only by the initial consonant sound. The /f/ sound in "fan" is voiceless, while the /v/ sound in "van" is voiced. This difference in voicing is enough to create a contrast between the two words.

Labiodental consonants can also convey meaning. For example, the /f/ sound is often used to indicate suddenness or surprise. This is because the /f/ sound is produced by a quick burst of air, which can be associated with sudden movement. The /v/ sound is often used to indicate softness or gentleness. This is because the /v/ sound is produced by a more gentle and controlled stream of air.

Labiodental consonants add variety to speech. They are relatively high-frequency sounds, which means that they stand out against the lower-frequency sounds of vowels and other consonants. This makes them useful for emphasizing words or phrases. Labiodental consonants are also relatively easy to produce, which makes them common sounds in children's speech.
