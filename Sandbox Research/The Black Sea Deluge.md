The formation of the Black Sea is a complex and ongoing process that has spanned millions of years. Geologists have pieced together the sea's history from evidence found in rocks, sediments, and fossils.

The Black Sea is a remnant of an ancient ocean called the Tethys Sea, which once covered much of Eurasia. The Tethys Sea began to shrink about 250 million years ago as a result of the collision of tectonic plates. Over time, the Black Sea basin became isolated from the Tethys Sea and gradually filled with freshwater from rivers and streams.

About 7,500 years ago, the rising Mediterranean Sea broke through a land barrier at the Bosporus Strait and flooded the Black Sea basin. This event, known as the Black Sea Deluge, caused a dramatic change in the sea's environment. The influx of saltwater killed off most of the freshwater creatures that had been living in the Black Sea, and new marine organisms from the Mediterranean moved in.

The Black Sea continues to evolve today. The sea's salinity is slowly increasing as more saltwater enters from the Mediterranean, and the sea's bottom is sinking under the weight of sediments that are carried in by rivers.

Here is a timeline of the key events in the formation of the Black Sea:

- **250 million years ago:** The Tethys Sea begins to shrink.
- **56 million years ago:** The Black Sea basin becomes isolated from the Tethys Sea.
- **7,500 years ago:** The Black Sea Deluge occurs.
- **Today:** The Black Sea continues to evolve.
