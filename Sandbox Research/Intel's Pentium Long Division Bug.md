The Intel Pentium FDIV bug was a significant hardware bug that affected certain Pentium microprocessors in the mid-1990s. This bug specifically impacted the Floating-Point Unit (FPU) of the Pentium processor and, more specifically, calculations involving long division.

The FDIV bug was discovered by Thomas Nicely, a professor of mathematics, in 1994. It manifested itself when performing certain floating-point division operations. When the Pentium processor was presented with certain pairs of numbers for division, it would produce incorrect results, sometimes with an error in the 9th or 10th decimal place.

Intel initially downplayed the significance of the bug, stating that it would only affect a very small percentage of users and that it was unlikely to occur in real-world applications. However, the bug's potential impact on scientific and financial calculations raised concerns among users, and it became a public relations nightmare for Intel.

As a result of the public outcry and concerns raised by large customers, Intel eventually offered a replacement program for affected Pentium processors. Users could contact Intel and receive a free replacement processor if they could demonstrate that their workloads might be affected by the bug. This move cost Intel an estimated $475 million.

The FDIV bug highlighted the importance of rigorous testing and quality assurance in microprocessor manufacturing. It also served as a reminder of the potential consequences of hardware bugs in critical computing systems.

In response to the FDIV bug incident, Intel implemented stricter testing and quality control procedures in its manufacturing processes to prevent similar issues in the future. The incident also had a lasting impact on the public perception of Intel's products and the importance of transparency and responsiveness when hardware issues arise.
