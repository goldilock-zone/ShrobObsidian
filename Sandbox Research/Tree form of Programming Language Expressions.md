The syntax of an expression can indeed be represented as a tree structure, often referred to as a syntax tree or parse tree. In such a tree, each node represents an element of the expression (e.g., an operator or operand), and the branches of the tree represent how these elements are combined or related. Here are some examples of expression syntax trees:

1. Arithmetic Expression Tree:

   Consider the arithmetic expression: `(5 + 3) * 2`

   The corresponding syntax tree would look like this:

   ```
       *
      / \
     +   2
    / \
   5   3
   ```

   In this tree, the `*` node represents multiplication, the `+` node represents addition, and the leaf nodes `5`, `3`, and `2` represent the operands.

2. Boolean Expression Tree:

   For a boolean expression: `(x > 5) && (y <= 10)`

   The syntax tree would be:

   ```
      &&
     /  \
    >    <=
   / \  /  \
  x   5 y  10
   ```

   In this tree, `&&` represents the logical AND operation, `>` and `<=` represent comparison operations, and `x`, `5`, `y`, and `10` are variables and constants.

3. Function Call Expression Tree:

   Suppose you have a function call: `sqrt(16)`

   The syntax tree for this function call might look like:

   ```
     sqrt
      |
      16
   ```

   Here, `sqrt` is the function being called, and `16` is the argument to the function.

4. Nested Expression Tree:

   Consider the expression: `3 * (4 + 2)`

   The corresponding syntax tree is:

   ```
      *
     / \
    3   +
       / \
      4   2
   ```

   In this example, the tree shows the multiplication of `3` by the result of `(4 + 2)`.

These examples demonstrate how expressions can be represented as tree structures where operators are internal nodes, and operands or subexpressions are leaf nodes. Syntax trees are commonly used in compilers and parsing processes to understand the structure of expressions and to evaluate or transform them.
