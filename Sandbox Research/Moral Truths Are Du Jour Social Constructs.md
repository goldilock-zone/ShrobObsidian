Certainly, here are some examples of "social constructs du jour," which are social constructs that are currently prevalent or fashionable in particular societies or contexts. Keep in mind that these constructs can evolve over time:

1. **Gender Identity**: In recent years, there has been a growing awareness and acceptance of diverse gender identities beyond the traditional binary concept of male and female. Non-binary, genderqueer, and other gender identities have gained recognition and are discussed as important social constructs du jour.

2. **Sexual Orientation**: Discussions and acceptance of various sexual orientations, such as homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality, have become more prominent in many societies. These constructs have evolved as societal attitudes toward LGBTQ+ individuals have changed.

3. **Body Positivity**: Body positivity is a social construct that promotes acceptance and appreciation of diverse body types and appearances. It has gained momentum as a reaction to unrealistic beauty standards in the media and fashion industries.

4. **Cultural Appropriation**: The concept of cultural appropriation, which involves borrowing elements of one culture by members of another culture, has become a significant topic of discussion in recent years. It reflects an awareness of the need for cultural sensitivity and respect.

5. **Environmental Awareness**: Environmental consciousness and sustainability have become social constructs du jour in response to growing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation. Concepts like reducing carbon footprint and eco-friendly practices are increasingly emphasized.

6. **Mental Health Stigma Reduction**: Efforts to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues and promote mental health awareness have gained traction. This social construct reflects a growing understanding of the importance of mental well-being.

7. **Intersectionality**: Intersectionality, which considers the interconnectedness of various social identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality, class) and their impact on individuals' experiences, is a construct that is gaining attention in discussions of social justice and equality.

8. **Technology Ethics**: As technology plays an increasingly significant role in society, discussions about the ethical use of technology, data privacy, and artificial intelligence have become social constructs of concern.

9. **Social Justice Activism**: Social justice movements, such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, have brought issues of racial inequality and gender-based discrimination to the forefront. These constructs represent current efforts to address systemic injustices.

10. **Mental Health Self-Care**: The idea of self-care, which emphasizes taking care of one's mental and emotional well-being, has become a popular social construct du jour, often associated with practices like mindfulness and self-compassion.

These examples illustrate how certain social constructs gain prominence and evolve over time in response to changing societal attitudes, values, and concerns. These constructs reflect the current issues and discussions within specific societies or contexts.
