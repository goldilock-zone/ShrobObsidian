An algebraic number field, a fundamental construct in algebraic number theory, is a finite degree field extension of the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$. This concept extends the usual notion of numbers to include more complex entities that are solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients.

To delve into its definition and characteristics:

1. **Field Extension**: 
   - A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain axioms like associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses.
   - An extension of a field $F$ is another field $K$ that contains $F$ as a subset. 

2. **Algebraic Numbers**:
   - An algebraic number is a complex number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients.
   - All rational numbers are algebraic, as they satisfy linear polynomials. However, not all algebraic numbers are rational. For instance, $\sqrt{2}$ is algebraic as it satisfies $x^2 - 2 = 0$.

3. **Finite Degree**:
   - The degree of a field extension $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, denoted as $[K:\mathbb{Q}]$, is the dimension of $K$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. 
   - A field extension is of finite degree if it has a finite basis as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$.

So, an algebraic number field $K$ is a field that contains $\mathbb{Q}$ and can be generated by a finite number of algebraic numbers over $\mathbb{Q}$. The elements of $K$ are themselves algebraic numbers.

An example is the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, generated by adjoining $\sqrt{2}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$. This field consists of all numbers of the form $a + b\sqrt{2}$ where $a$ and $b$ are rational. The degree of this field extension is $2$, as $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$ forms a basis for this field over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Algebraic number fields are central in number theory because they generalize the properties of rational numbers and help in understanding solutions to polynomial equations, leading to insights into various areas like Diophantine equations, class field theory, and arithmetic geometry.
