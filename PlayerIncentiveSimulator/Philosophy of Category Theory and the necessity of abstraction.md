Abstractions as a useful tool in this kind of study, is exemplified by an analogy in mathematics, in category theory, and its philosophy. Category theory, in its utilitarian proposition as a study of connections [^1], would act as a common basis from which mathematics can be approached.  This is in contrast to building up theories from "nodal" axioms, giving support to a proposition of mathematics in its architectonic form, rather than a pillarized theoretical construct. This approach to abstraction, especially in a philosophically polemicized field like economics, and the fundamental study of inequality, would open up opportunities for a similar build up of theory on the architectonic of the proposed thought experiment. This would be along the lines of the arguments of Paul Krugman, in favor of allowing critiques of economics from other fields.[^2]
Holmes, [^3] in his investigation into Abstract Realism, described his efforts as having changed his perspectives on abstraction as an aesthetic category, while moving it "irrevocably towards the actual operational, material, philosophical and political effects of artistic abstraction". This is the approach to abstraction that the thought experiment would attempt to take.
