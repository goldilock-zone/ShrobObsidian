The players at the outset are distributed evenly throughout the game board. This is done in order to simulate "equality" at the beginning of the game. This is to control for any inequalities in the outset of the game. The players in the simulation have a localized information boundary, which is an analogue to the fact that any player under resource constraints, in an information field with other players would not be expected to have all information. The player's propensity to prospect for incentives would be affected by the amount of localized information available to it. The player attempts, in each game cycle (insert citation about game development paradigm) to move toward the region in its localized information field that has the highest density of incentives. This action, in the internal algorithm of the player, is an abstraction for the tendency of players in a resource field to seek out, and consume resources. 
All the players also start out with a "score" of 0. This increases when the players interact with the incentives, on the game board. As an incentive breaches the radius of a player, the player "consumes" it, and the radius of the player commensurately increases. 
The increase in radius is meant as an abstraction for increasing wealth, improving access to further opportunities.
