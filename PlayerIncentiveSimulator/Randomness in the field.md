Randomness in the information field can have several definitions. The randomness shown in the simulations for the thought experiment are generated out of a pesudo-random number generator, that attempts to set up the incentives in r2 Space, with acceptable degrees of randomness. Alternative settings of the experiment would sample from different types of distributions, and simulate concentrations in certain areas of space. These enquiries would instructive in their explanations about the resulting structure of data.
