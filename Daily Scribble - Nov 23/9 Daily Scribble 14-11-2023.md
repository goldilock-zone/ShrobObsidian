## Notes from reading the third policeman
- Before I go I will tell you this. I am your soul and all your souls. When I am gone you are dead. Past humanity is not only implicit in each new man born but is contained in him. Humanity is an ever-widening spiral and life is the beam that plays briefly on each succeeding ring. All humanity from its beginning to its end is already present but the beam has not yet played beyond you. Your earthly successors await dumbly and trust to your guidance and mine and all my people inside me to preserve them and lead the light further. You are not now the top of your people’s line any more than your mother was when she had you inside her. When I leave you I take with me all that has made you what you are – I take all your significance and importance and all the accumulations of human instinct and appetite and wisdom and dignity. You will be left with nothing behind you and nothing to give the waiting ones. Woe to you when they find you out! Goodbye!
- ‘We have a machine down there,’ the Sergeant continued, ‘that splits up any smell into its sub-and inter-smells the way you can split up a beam of light with a glass instrument.
- "Hors de combat" is a French term that literally translates to "out of the fight." It is used in international law and military contexts to describe soldiers who are incapable of performing their duties due to injury, illness, or capture. These individuals are considered non-combatants and, according to the laws of war, should not be attacked or harmed. This principle is a key aspect of the Geneva Conventions, which set out the standards for humanitarian treatment during war. The term underscores the importance of protecting those who are no longer able to participate in hostilities, whether due to physical incapacitation or other reasons.

	"Smut" can refer to different things based on the context:
	
	1. **In Literature and Media**: In contemporary usage, "smut" often refers to sexually explicit or pornographic material in literature, films, or other media. This type of content is typically characterized by its primary focus on sexual themes and imagery.
	
	2. **In Agriculture and Biology**: In a completely different context, "smut" is a term used in agriculture and biology to refer to a type of fungus or fungal disease affecting plants, particularly grains like corn and wheat. These fungi can cause significant damage to crops.
	
	The meaning of the term varies significantly depending on the context in which it's used. In everyday conversation, it's more commonly associated with the first meaning relating to sexually explicit material.

- We can use complex numbers to factorize anything really
- The property of a unique representation by primes carries over to this version of factorization
- But if we adjoin other numbers, this uniqueness property probably doesn't hold
- What is the notion of primes in the complex plane, and other adjoining number system? #toread
- But sqrt(-163), being adjoined to the number system works, in terms of preserving uniqueness
- Gauss conjectured that this was the last one
- Ramanujan finding "numbers" are built out of transcendentals, that are in fact very close to whole number
- Weirdly e^sqrt((163)*pi) is a whole number (close to actually)
- And the 163 can be replaced with some y, and those y's, when adjoined to some number system hold the property of being uniquely prime factorized

- Look at the ranges first
- Find the valid interval and check the inequality condition
- Consider the general case, after checking cases, that's normally good practise
