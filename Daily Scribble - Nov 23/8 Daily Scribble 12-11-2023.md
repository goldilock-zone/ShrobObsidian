# Expanded Notes

1. **Non-linear Systems and Linguistic Axiomatics**: Non-linear systems in mathematics and science often exhibit complex, unpredictable behaviors that cannot be fully described by traditional linear axioms. This relates to the idea that linguistic structures (used in logic and mathematics) may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity of natural phenomena.

2. **Laplacian Determinism**: Refers to the philosophical idea that if someone (a hypothetical "Laplace's Demon") knew the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, the future and past could be perfectly predicted. This contrasts with the concept of randomness and suggests a universe completely determined by initial conditions.

3. **Randomness and Determination**: The idea here challenges the traditional view of randomness as entirely outside of deterministic systems. It suggests that what appears as random may still be a part of a larger deterministic framework.

4. **Hilbert's Program**: This was an early 20th-century initiative in mathematics aiming to provide a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics. It was significantly impacted by Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

5. **DNA as a Linguistic Program**: This analogy likens the genetic code to a language or programming system. It raises questions about whether DNA, like a linguistic system, might be incomplete or subject to limitations in expressing biological complexity.

6. **Diversity and Noise**: This note suggests a political interpretation of biological diversity, possibly critiquing views that attribute diversity solely to genetic "noise" or randomness rather than deterministic processes.

7. **Schrodinger's "Code-Script"**: Refers to Erwin Schrödinger's idea that chromosomes contain a "code-script" for an organism's development. The question here is whether this script is fully deterministic.

8. **Venter on the Human Genome**: Craig Venter, a prominent figure in genomics, noted that decoding the human genome did not lead to a complete understanding of human biology, suggesting the complexity and potential incompleteness of genetic information.

9. **Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**: This principle posits that information flows from DNA to RNA to protein but not in reverse. The question raised here is about the completeness and exclusivity of this information flow.

10. **Genes for Complex Traits**: Refers to the identification of genes associated with complex human behaviors and traits, such as marital infidelity or longevity.

11. **Incompleteness in Science**: Recognizes that incomplete systems or theories can still be useful and valuable in scientific understanding.

12. **Exact Stereospecificity of Macromolecules**: This involves the idea that molecular interactions, like enzyme-substrate interactions, are highly specific ("key-lock paradigm"). This specificity is fundamental to biological processes.

13. **Impact of Artificial Molecules**: This point raises concerns about how synthetic molecules, like drugs or pollutants, might affect human evolution and health.

14. **Linguistification of DNA and GMOs**: Discusses the concept of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as a form of applying linguistic (programming) principles to biology, altering the genetic "language."

15. **Environmental Impact of GMOs**: Addresses the broader ecological and environmental implications of genetically modified organisms.

16. **Gene-Protein Isomorphism**: This is about the relationship between genes and the proteins they encode. The note suggests skepticism about a one-to-one correspondence between a single gene and a single protein.

17. **From Central Dogma to Closure Constraints**: Suggests a shift in thinking from a linear flow of genetic information to a more complex system of constraints and interactions within biological systems.
