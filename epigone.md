The term "epigone" typically refers to someone who imitates or emulates the style, ideas, or achievements of a notable predecessor or a more influential figure. It often carries a somewhat negative connotation, suggesting that the person lacks originality and merely copies the work or ideas of others without significant innovation or creative contribution.

In the context of literature, art, and intellectual pursuits, an epigone might be seen as a derivative or imitative writer, artist, or thinker who follows in the footsteps of a more original and groundbreaking predecessor. The term is sometimes used to criticize those who mimic the work of a great master without adding new insights or advancing the field.

It's worth noting that the use of the term "epigone" can be subjective and judgmental, and not all imitators or followers of established figures are necessarily considered in a negative light. Some individuals may build upon the work of others in meaningful ways and make valuable contributions to their respective fields, even if they were initially influenced by someone else.
