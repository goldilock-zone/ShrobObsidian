Euler's Totient Function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, is a significant arithmetic function in number theory. It is defined as the count of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime (relatively prime) to $n$. In other words, $\phi(n)$ gives the number of integers between $1$ and $n$ that share no common factors (other than 1) with $n$.

To compute Euler's Totient Function for a positive integer $n$, we can follow a systematic approach:

**Step 1:** Decompose $n$ into its prime factors. Let's represent $n$ as a product of its prime factors:
$$n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k},$$
where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers, and $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ are their respective multiplicities in the prime factorization.

**Step 2:** Calculate $\phi(p_i^{a_i})$ for each prime factor $p_i^{a_i}$:
$$\phi(p_i^{a_i}) = p_i^{a_i} - p_i^{a_i-1},$$
where $p_i^{a_i}$ is the power of the prime $p_i$ raised to $a_i$, and $p_i^{a_i-1}$ is the power of the prime $p_i$ raised to $a_i-1$. This formula is based on the fact that the number of integers between $1$ and $p_i^{a_i}$ that are divisible by $p_i$ is $p_i^{a_i-1}$.

**Step 3:** Calculate $\phi(n)$ using the values obtained in step 2:
$$\phi(n) = \phi(p_1^{a_1}) \cdot \phi(p_2^{a_2}) \cdot \ldots \cdot \phi(p_k^{a_k}).$$
This is possible because, for coprime numbers, their totients multiply together.

**Step 4:** Compute $\phi(n)$ by multiplying the values calculated in step 3.

Let's illustrate this process with an example:

**Example:** Compute $\phi(36)$.

**Step 1:** Prime factorization of $36$ is $36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2$.

**Step 2:** Calculate $\phi(2^2)$ and $\phi(3^2)$.
- $\phi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2^1 = 4 - 2 = 2$.
- $\phi(3^2) = 3^2 - 3^1 = 9 - 3 = 6$.

**Step 3:** Calculate $\phi(36)$ using the values obtained in step 2.
$$\phi(36) = \phi(2^2) \cdot \phi(3^2) = 2 \cdot 6 = 12.$$

So, $\phi(36) = 12$. This means there are $12$ positive integers less than or equal to $36$ that are coprime to $36$.

Euler's Totient Function has several important properties and applications in number theory, including its connection to Euler's Totient Theorem, which states that if $a$ is coprime to $n$, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, where $\equiv$ denotes congruence modulo $n$. This theorem has applications in various areas of number theory, including modular arithmetic and cryptography.

# Multiplicativeness of Euler's Totient Function
### Multiplicativeness of Euler's Totient Function

The Euler's Totient Function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, is a fundamental arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime (relatively prime) to $n$. In this explanation, we will explore the multiplicativeness property of Euler's Totient Function and provide a proof using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).

#### Euler's Totient Function $\phi(n)$
To define Euler's Totient Function, we start with a positive integer $n$. $\phi(n)$ is the count of positive integers between $1$ and $n$ that are coprime to $n$. In other words, $\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integers $k$ such that $\gcd(n, k) = 1$ (where $\gcd$ represents the greatest common divisor).

#### Multiplicativeness Property
The multiplicativeness property of Euler's Totient Function states that if two positive integers $m$ and $n$ are coprime (i.e., $\gcd(m, n) = 1$), then the totient function of their product is equal to the product of their totient functions, i.e., $\phi(mn) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)$.

#### Proof Using CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem)
To prove the multiplicativeness property of Euler's Totient Function, we will employ the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's consider two coprime positive integers, $m$ and $n$, with their respective prime factorizations as follows:

- $m = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k}$ (where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime factors of $m$)
- $n = q_1^{b_1} \cdot q_2^{b_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot q_l^{b_l}$ (where $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_l$ are distinct prime factors of $n$)

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, it follows that all of their prime factors are distinct. In other words, $p_i \neq q_j$ for all $i$ and $j$. Now, let's find $\phi(mn)$, $\phi(m)$, and $\phi(n)$.

#### Euler's Totient Function for Prime Powers
For a prime power $p^a$, where $p$ is a prime and $a$ is a positive integer, the Euler's Totient Function is given by $\phi(p^a) = p^a - p^{a-1}$. This is a well-known result derived from combinatorial arguments.

Now, using the prime factorizations of $m$ and $n$, we can calculate $\phi(mn)$, $\phi(m)$, and $\phi(n)$:

- $\phi(mn) = \phi\left(p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k} \cdot q_1^{b_1} \cdot q_2^{b_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot q_l^{b_l}\right)$

Using the multiplicativeness of $\phi$ for prime powers, we have:

- $\phi(mn) = \left(p_1^{a_1} - p_1^{a_1-1}\right) \cdot \left(p_2^{a_2} - p_2^{a_2-1}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(q_1^{b_1} - q_1^{b_1-1}\right) \cdot \left(q_2^{b_2} - q_2^{b_2-1}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(q_l^{b_l} - q_l^{b_l-1}\right)$

Now, let's calculate $\phi(m)$ and $\phi(n)$ using their prime factorizations in a similar manner:

- $\phi(m) = \left(p_1^{a_1} - p_1^{a_1-1}\right) \cdot \left(p_2^{a_2} - p_2^{a_2-1}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(p_k^{a_k} - p_k^{a_k-1}\right)$
- $\phi(n) = \left(q_1^{b_1} - q_1^{b_1-1}\right) \cdot \left(q_2^{b_2} - q_2^{b_2-1}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(q_l^{b_l} - q_l^{b_l-1}\right)$

Now, if we multiply $\phi(m)$ and $\phi(n)$ together, we obtain:

$\phi(m) \cdot \phi(n) = \left(p_1^{a_1} - p_1^{a_1-1}\right) \cdot \left(p_2^{a_2} - p_2^{a_2-1}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(q_1^{b_1} - q_1^{b_1-1}\right) \cdot \left(q_2^{b_2} - q_2^{b_2-1}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(q_l^{b_l} - q_l^{b_l-1}\right)$

As you can see, this expression is identical to $\phi(mn)$.

#### Conclusion
Therefore, we have shown that $\phi(mn) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)$ when $m$ and $n$ are coprime, using the prime factorizations of $m$ and $n$ and the multiplicativeness of Euler's Totient Function for prime powers. This establishes the multiplicativeness property of Euler's Totient Function, which is a crucial result in number theory.

# Closed form formula for Euler's Totient Function
To prove a formula for Euler's Totient Function, we will first introduce some necessary concepts and then proceed with the proof. Euler's Totient Function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, represents the count of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime to $n$.

Let's consider a positive integer $n$. We want to find a formula for $\phi(n)$. We'll break down the proof into several steps:

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of n
We start by expressing $n$ as a product of its prime factors. Let $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ be the distinct prime factors of $n$, and let $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k$ be their respective exponents in the prime factorization. Therefore, we can write:

$$
n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{e_k}
$$

### Step 2: Counting Coprime Integers
Now, we want to count the positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime to $n$. 

For each prime factor $p_i$, the integers that are not coprime to $n$ are those divisible by $p_i$. So, for each $p_i$, there are $\frac{n}{p_i}$ integers less than or equal to $n$ that are divisible by $p_i$. 

However, some integers may be divisible by more than one prime factor. To avoid overcounting, we need to subtract the integers divisible by the pairwise product of the prime factors, those divisible by $p_i p_j$ for $i \neq j$. 

Continuing this process, we find that the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ that are divisible by the product of $r$ distinct prime factors is:

$$
\frac{n}{p_1} \cdot \frac{n}{p_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{n}{p_r}
$$

### Step 3: Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
To find the count of integers that are coprime to $n$, we apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. It states that to find the size of the union of multiple sets, we must subtract the sizes of their pairwise intersections.

So, the number of integers coprime to $n$ is:

$$
\phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \ldots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
$$

### Step 4: Simplification
We can simplify this expression further by using the fact that $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{e_k}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(n) &= n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \ldots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right) \\
&= p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{e_k} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \ldots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

This gives us a formula for Euler's Totient Function:

$$
\phi(n) = n \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \ldots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
$$

where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$, and $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k$ are their respective exponents in the prime factorization of $n$. This formula allows us to compute Euler's Totient Function for any positive integer $n$ given its prime factorization.

# Probabilistic Interpretation
In order to understand the probabilistic interpretation of Euler's Totient Function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, we need to delve into the concept of coprime integers and their relationship with prime factorization. 

### Coprime Integers:

Two positive integers $a$ and $b$ are said to be coprime or relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, i.e., $\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1$. Coprime integers share no common prime factors other than 1. For example, 15 and 28 are coprime because their only common divisor is 1.

### Prime Factorization:

Any positive integer $n$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of its prime factors raised to their respective powers. This is known as the prime factorization of $n$:

$$
n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k}
$$

Where:
- $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$.
- $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ are the corresponding exponents.

### Probabilistic Interpretation:

Now, consider a positive integer $n$. We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than or equal to $n$ is coprime to $n$. In other words, we are interested in the likelihood that a randomly chosen integer $k$ from the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}$ is coprime to $n$.

To determine this probability, let's focus on the prime factors of $n$. For each prime factor $p_i$, the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than or equal to $n$ is divisible by $p_i$ is $\frac{1}{p_i}$. This is because there is exactly one integer out of every $p_i^{a_i}$ integers that is divisible by $p_i$.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen integer is not divisible by $p_i$ (i.e., coprime to $n$ with respect to $p_i$) is $1 - \frac{1}{p_i}$.

### Probability of Being Coprime to $n$:

By the principle of multiplication for independent events, the probability that a randomly chosen integer is coprime to $n$ (i.e., coprime with respect to all prime factors of $n$) is the product of the individual probabilities:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Probability of being coprime to } n &= \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right) \\
&= \prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)
\end{align*}
$$
Here, the product runs over all prime factors $p$ of $n$, and the expression $\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)$ represents the probability that a randomly chosen integer is coprime to $n$ with respect to the prime factor $p$.

### Euler's Totient Function:

Remarkably, this probability is precisely what Euler's Totient Function, $\phi(n)$, computes. Therefore, Euler's Totient Function, $\phi(n)$, represents the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer less than or equal to $n$ is coprime to $n$, taking into account the prime factorization of $n$. This probabilistic interpretation provides valuable insights into the nature of coprime integers and their relationship with prime factors.

# Finding all numbers n with $\phi(n) = 24$
To find all numbers $n$ with Euler's Totient Function equal to 24, we can use Euler's Totient Function formula:

$$
\phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\ldots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\phi(n)$ is the Euler's Totient Function of $n$.
- $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$.

We want to find $n$ such that $\phi(n) = 24$. First, let's analyze the prime factorization of 24:

$$
24 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1
$$

Now, we need to consider different cases for the prime factorization of $n$ to satisfy $\phi(n) = 24$. We will consider the following cases:

1. If $n$ is prime:
   - In this case, $\phi(n) = n - 1$.
   - We need $n - 1 = 24$, which implies $n = 25$.

2. If $n$ is a power of a prime:
   - Let $n = p^k$, where $p$ is a prime.
   - Using the Euler's Totient Function formula, we have:
     $$
     \phi(n) = p^k \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right) = 24
     $$
   - Since $p$ is prime, we can rewrite it as:
     $$
     p^{k-1}(p - 1) = 24
     $$
   - We can now consider the prime factorization of 24: $24 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1$.
   
   - Case 1: $p = 2$
     - If $p = 2$, then $k - 1$ can only be 2 (to match the power of 2 in the prime factorization of 24).
     - This gives us $k = 3$, so $n = 2^3 = 8$.

   - Case 2: $p = 3$
     - If $p = 3$, then $k - 1$ can only be 1 (to match the power of 3 in the prime factorization of 24).
     - This gives us $k = 2$, so $n = 3^2 = 9$.

3. If $n$ has multiple prime factors:
   - Let $n = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_m^{k_m}$, where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are distinct primes.
   - Using the Euler's Totient Function formula, we have:
     $$
     \phi(n) = n\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\ldots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right) = 24
     $$
   - We can now consider different combinations of prime factors that result in $\phi(n) = 24$.

After considering all cases, the numbers $n$ with Euler's Totient Function equal to 24 are $25$, $8$, and $9$.

# Carmichael Conjecture

The Carmichael Conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis related to the behavior of Carmichael numbers. A Carmichael number is a composite number that satisfies the modular arithmetic property known as Fermat's Little Theorem.

## Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then:

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$

This theorem is a fundamental result in number theory and has various applications in cryptography and primality testing.

## Carmichael Numbers

A Carmichael number is a composite integer $n$ that satisfies Fermat's Little Theorem for all integers $a$ such that $\gcd(a, n) = 1$, where $\gcd$ represents the greatest common divisor. In other words, for a Carmichael number $n$, we have:

$$
a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$

for all $a$ coprime to $n$.

## The Carmichael Conjecture

The Carmichael Conjecture proposes that Carmichael numbers are the only composite numbers that satisfy Fermat's Little Theorem for all coprime bases $a$. In other words, if a composite number $n$ satisfies:

$$
a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$

for all integers $a$ coprime to $n$, then $n$ must be a Carmichael number.

### Questions and Considerations

1. Are there any known counterexamples to the Carmichael Conjecture?
2. What is the smallest known Carmichael number?
3. How does the Carmichael Conjecture relate to other unsolved problems in number theory?
4. What are the potential implications for cryptography and number theory if the conjecture were to be proven true or false?
5. Are there any computational methods or algorithms used to search for Carmichael numbers?

The Carmichael Conjecture continues to be an intriguing problem in number theory, and its resolution would have significant implications for our understanding of composite numbers and modular arithmetic.

# Carmichael in the context of the Euler Totient Function
"Given $n$, can we find $m \neq n$ with $\varphi(m) = \varphi(n)$?"

Here, $\varphi$ denotes Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. The conjecture in question seems to be related to the search for different numbers $m$ and $n$ that share the same totient value.

In the context of Carmichael numbers, these are composite numbers that satisfy the modular arithmetic condition $b^{n-1} \equiv 1 \mod n$ for all integers $b$ that are relatively prime to $n$. They are related to the totient function because this property mimics that of prime numbers, for which Euler's theorem states that $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$ for any $a$ relatively prime to $n$.

The Carmichael numbers are a sequence of numbers which are counterexamples to the base assumption that if $b^{n-1} \equiv 1 \mod n$ holds for a range of $b$ values, then $n$ is prime. Carmichael's conjecture, which was proven to be false, stated that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers.

In terms of finding $m \neq n$ such that $\varphi(m) = \varphi(n)$, this is a known phenomenon and there are many pairs of distinct numbers with this property, which is a topic of interest in number theory. 

# Significance of $\phi(n) = 2^k$
In number theory, we often encounter numbers whose Euler totient function is a power of 2. These numbers hold special significance in various mathematical contexts, particularly in the construction of regular polygons (n-gons) and Gauss's proof thereof.

**Euler Totient Function (φ)**:
The Euler totient function, denoted as φ(n), represents the count of positive integers less than or equal to n that are coprime (have no common factors) with n. In mathematical notation, it is defined as:

$$
\phi(n) = \text{Count of } k \text{ such that } 1 \leq k \leq n \text{ and } \text{gcd}(k, n) = 1
$$

**Numbers with φ(n) as a Power of 2**:
When φ(n) is a power of 2, i.e., φ(n) = 2^k for some non-negative integer k, these numbers have interesting properties. 

**Cyclic Groups and Regular n-gons**:
One of the most notable applications is in the construction of regular n-gons. A regular n-gon is a polygon with n sides and equal angles between each pair of adjacent sides. Gauss proved that a regular n-gon can be constructed using only a compass and straightedge if and only if n is the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes (primes of the form 2^(2^m) + 1).

**Gauss's Proof**:

The construction of regular polygons, specifically regular n-gons (polygons with n equal sides and angles), has been a classical problem in geometry. Carl Friedrich Gauss, the renowned mathematician, made significant contributions to this problem by providing a proof of when it is possible to construct regular n-gons using only a compass and straightedge.

**The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**:
To begin our exploration, we must first acknowledge a fundamental theorem of algebra: every polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n complex roots, taking into account multiplicity. For a polynomial equation in the form of:

$$
a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0 = 0
$$

It has n complex roots, which may be real or complex, and some of these roots might be repeated.

**Constructibility of Regular n-gons**:
Now, let's delve into the problem of constructing regular n-gons. Gauss showed that a regular n-gon can be constructed with a compass and straightedge if and only if n can be expressed in the form:

$$
n = 2^k \cdot p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_r
$$

Where:
- **k** is a non-negative integer.
- **p1, p2, p3, ... pr** are distinct Fermat primes. Fermat primes are prime numbers of the form 2^(2^m) + 1, where m is a non-negative integer.

**Gauss's Proof**:
- Gauss's proof is a culmination of various concepts, and it involves considering the roots of unity. Roots of unity are complex numbers that, when raised to the power of n, yield 1. In mathematical notation, the nth roots of unity are denoted as:
	
	$$
	\omega_k = e^{\frac{2\pi i k}{n}}
	$$
	
	Where k ranges from 0 to n-1.
	
	Gauss's key insight was that constructing a regular n-gon is equivalent to finding a solution to the equation:
	
	$$
	x^n = 1
	$$
	
	This equation has n roots of unity, and if n can be expressed as mentioned above, then these roots of unity can be constructed using a compass and straightedge.
	
	Gauss's proof involves showing that if n is of the form mentioned earlier, then it is possible to construct the regular n-gon by geometrically finding the roots of unity using ruler and compass. Conversely, if n cannot be expressed in this form, then it is impossible to construct the regular n-gon.
	
	**Conclusion**:
	Carl Friedrich Gauss's proof regarding the construction of regular n-gons is a remarkable demonstration of the interplay between algebra and geometry. It relies on the properties of complex numbers, the roots of unity, and the fundamental theorem of algebra. This proof not only provided a solution to a classical geometric problem but also deepened our understanding of number theory and the properties of integers.

**Example**:
Let's consider an example where φ(n) = 2^k. If φ(n) = 8 (2^3), it means that there are eight positive integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. In this case, n can be expressed as a product of a power of 2 and other primes, enabling the construction of a regular polygon.

**Conclusion**:
Numbers whose Euler totient function is a power of 2 play a crucial role in the study of regular polygons, as highlighted by Gauss's proof. Understanding the properties of such numbers helps in determining the constructability of regular n-gons using compass and straightedge, providing valuable insights into the realm of geometry and number theory.

# Bounds on the Euler Totient Function
**Finding Bounds for the Euler Totient Function**

The Euler Totient Function, $\varphi(n)$, is key in number theory, counting integers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds for $\varphi(n)$.

**Upper Bound for $\varphi(n)$**:

1. **Upper Bound Theorem**: $\varphi(n) \leq n$. This follows because at most $n$ integers can be coprime with $n$, occurring when $n$ is prime.

**Lower Bound for $\varphi(n)$**:

1. **Prime Factorization**: For the lower bound, consider $n$'s prime factorization: $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdot p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdot ... \cdot p_k^{\alpha_k}$, with distinct primes $p_i$ and multiplicities $\alpha_i$.

2. **Lower Bound Theorem**: The lower bound is the product of $(1 - \frac{1}{p_i})$ for each prime $p_i$:

   $$
   \varphi(n) \geq n \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdot ... \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
   $$

   This is minimal for prime powers ($n = p_i^{\alpha_i}$), as fewer numbers are coprime with $n$.

**Example**:

Take $n = 30$ with prime factors 2, 3, 5. By the theorem:

$$
\varphi(30) \geq 30 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 30 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 8
$$

Thus, $\varphi(30) \geq 8$, matching the 8 coprime numbers {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}.

**Conclusion**:

$\varphi(n)$ is vital in number theory. Its upper bound is simply $n$, while the lower bound is the product of $(1 - \frac{1}{p_i})$ for each prime factor $p_i$. These bounds give us a range for $\varphi(n)$ for any $n$.

# Average Value of $\frac{\phi(n)}{n}$

- Chance that a number is co prime to n
- What is the chance that two number, m and n chosen at random are co prime.

# Probability that two integers m and n are co prime to each other 
1. **Probability Expression**:
   The probability that $m$ and $n$ are coprime is approximated by the infinite product:
   $$
   \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{3^2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5^2}\right)\cdots
   $$
   This product includes terms for all primes, reflecting that the only common factors that matter are prime factors.

2. **Inversion of Terms**:
   Each term is then written as a sum of an infinite geometric series:
   $$
   \left(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}\right), \left(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}}\right), \ldots
   $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$
   \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \cdots\right), \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots\right), \ldots
   $$
   
3. **Series Convergence**:
   It is noted that the infinite series $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2}$ converges, which is a reference to the Basel problem, where the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the natural numbers is $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$. This is known as Euler's solution to the Basel problem and is denoted here by "EULER".

4. **Final Expression**:
   The final expression on the board equates Euler's constant for this problem, denoted as $\theta$, to $\frac{6}{\pi^2}$, which is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers.

In summary, the whiteboard outlines a probabilistic argument related to the Euler Totient function, specifically regarding the probability that two integers are coprime. It employs the idea that this probability is the product of the probabilities that $m$ and $n$ are not both divisible by any given prime, which is $1 - \frac{1}{p^2}$ for a prime $p$. Multiplying these probabilities over all primes gives the probability that $m$ and $n$ are coprime. This probability is shown to be connected to the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of natural numbers, a famous result in number theory.


# Link between Reimann Zeta function and the Euler Totient Function

The Riemann Zeta function, $\zeta(s)$, is defined for a complex variable $s$ with real part greater than 1 by the series $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$. This function can be analytically continued to other values of $s$ except $s=1$, where it has a simple pole. 

The Euler Totient function $\varphi(n)$, on the other hand, is defined for a positive integer $n$ as the number of integers less than $n$ that are coprime to $n$. 

The connection between these two functions arises in analytic number theory, particularly in the study of the distribution of prime numbers. One of the ways the link is expressed is through Euler's product formula for the Riemann Zeta function:

$$
\zeta(s) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}}.
$$

This infinite product over all primes $p$ converges absolutely for $\Re(s) > 1$ and shows that $\zeta(s)$ is intimately connected to the primes.

Now, consider the Euler product formula's logarithm:

$$
\log(\zeta(s)) = - \sum_{p \text{ prime}} \log(1 - p^{-s}) = \sum_{p \text{ prime}} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{p^{-ks}}{k},
$$

where the double series converges absolutely for $\Re(s) > 1$. 

To link this with the Euler Totient function, observe the identity involving $\varphi(n)$:

$$
\frac{\varphi(n)}{n} = \prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right),
$$

where the product is over all primes $p$ that divide $n$. If we take $s=2$ in the Euler product for $\zeta(s)$, we get:

$$
\zeta(2) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1 - p^{-2}} = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{p^4} + \dots \right).
$$

By comparing the expression for $\frac{\varphi(n)}{n}$ with the individual factors of $\zeta(2)$, we can see that each factor is the sum of the probabilities that a random integer is not divisible by any power of $p$. The product of these sums over all primes gives the probability that two randomly chosen integers are coprime, which is $\frac{1}{\zeta(2)} = \frac{6}{\pi^2}$, a result that also appears in the study of the Euler Totient function. 

Therefore, the Riemann Zeta function at $s=2$ provides the average value of $\frac{\varphi(n)}{n}$ over all $n$, which is an elegant bridge between the Riemann Zeta function and the Euler Totient function. This connection extends to other values of $s$ and provides deep insights into the nature of prime numbers and their distribution.


# Proof That  $\sum_{d|n} \varphi(d) = n$


$$ \sum_{d|n} \varphi(d) = n. $$

This identity is a well-known result in number theory and can be proved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or via the properties of multiplicative functions.

Here's a proof using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

The Euler's totient function $\varphi(n)$ counts the positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. 

Now, consider the set $A = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. We want to count the elements of $A$ that are not relatively prime to $n$. We can do this by counting the numbers in $A$ that are multiples of the divisors of $n$.

For each divisor $d$ of $n$, let $A_d$ be the subset of $A$ consisting of the multiples of $d$. Then, the number of elements in $A_d$ is exactly $\frac{n}{d}$.

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the size of the union of all $A_d$ is given by:

$$ \left| \bigcup_{d|n} A_d \right| = \sum_{d|n} \left| A_d \right| - \sum_{d_1, d_2|n, d_1 < d_2} \left| A_{d_1} \cap A_{d_2} \right| + \sum_{d_1, d_2, d_3|n, d_1 < d_2 < d_3} \left| A_{d_1} \cap A_{d_2} \cap A_{d_3} \right| - \ldots + (-1)^{r+1} \left| A_{d_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{d_r} \right|, $$

where $r$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$.

However, we know that $A_{d_1} \cap A_{d_2}$ is just the set of multiples of the least common multiple of $d_1$ and $d_2$, which is $\frac{n}{\text{lcm}(d_1, d_2)}$. This pattern continues for the intersections of more sets.

Since $\varphi(d)$ is the count of numbers less than or equal to $d$ that are coprime to $d$, for each divisor $d$ of $n$, the multiples of $d$ in $A$ that are not relatively prime to $n$ are exactly $\frac{n}{d} - \varphi(d)$. 

If we subtract from $n$ the count of numbers that are not relatively prime to $n$ (that is, the size of the union of all $A_d$), we should get the sum of the $\varphi(d)$ values:

$$ n - \left| \bigcup_{d|n} A_d \right| = \sum_{d|n} \varphi(d). $$

But by construction, the left-hand side is just $n$, because we're removing from $n$ all the numbers that are not coprime to it, which leaves exactly the numbers that are coprime to it, whose count is $n$ itself. 

Hence, we have proved that:

$$ \sum_{d|n} \varphi(d) = n. $$

This is an outline of the proof. The actual details would involve a careful application of the principle of inclusion-exclusion to account for all the intersections of the sets $A_d$.
