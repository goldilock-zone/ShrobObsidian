In phonetics, a plosive, also known as an occlusive or simply a stop, is a pulmonic consonant sound produced by a complete closure of the vocal tract. The closure is typically made with the tongue, lips, or velum, and the release of the closure produces an audible burst of air, hence the name "plosive."

Plosives are common sounds in all languages, and they are often used to mark the beginning of syllables. Examples of plosives in English include the sounds /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, and /g/.

Here is a table of the six plosives in English:

|Plosive|IPA Symbol|Description|
|---|---|---|
|voiceless bilabial plosive|/p/|Produced by closing the lips|
|voiced bilabial plosive|/b/|Produced by closing the lips and vibrating the vocal cords|
|voiceless alveolar plosive|/t/|Produced by placing the tongue tip against the alveolar ridge|
|voiced alveolar plosive|/d/|Produced by placing the tongue tip against the alveolar ridge and vibrating the vocal cords|
|voiceless velar plosive|/k/|Produced by raising the back of the tongue against the velum|
|voiced velar plosive|/g/|Produced by raising the back of the tongue against the velum and vibrating the vocal cords|
