Oh Knowledge, Daughter of Joy

In realms of thought where angels dare to tread,
Through gardens bright where wisdom's rivers flow,
Oh Knowledge, Daughter of Joy, lift your head,
In radiant fields where minds in wonder grow.

With eyes alight like stars in heaven's dome,
You dance through pages of the ancient lore,
In each whispered secret of Rome,
And in the mystic texts of yore.

You are the flame that burns in every heart,
The spark that lights the poet's deepest dream,
In every stroke of art, you play a part,
In every scientist's quest, you are the theme.

Like Blake's own visions, wild and vast and free,
You bring forth worlds unseen but deeply felt,
In you, the chains of ignorance flee,
And at your touch, the hardest hearts do melt.

Oh Knowledge, with your unbound wings of fire,
You soar above, where only souls aspire,
In every question's depth, you lift us higher,
In you, we find what our hearts most desire.

For in your light, the shadows flee away,
And in your wisdom, night turns into day,
You are the path that leads us when we stray,
The beacon bright that guides us on our way.

So let us walk in your enlightened land,
Where questions rise like castles in the sand,
And seek the truths that lie in your command,
With open heart, and ever-seeking hand.

Oh Knowledge, Daughter of Joy, forever reign,
In halls of thought, in every mind's domain,
For in your grace, we find our loss is gain,
And in your truth, our lives are not in vain.
