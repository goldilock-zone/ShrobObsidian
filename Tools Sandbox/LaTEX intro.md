Certainly, LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system used extensively for producing scientific and mathematical documents due to its capability to handle complex notations and structures. Here's a brief overview of how LaTeX can be used, especially in the context of mathematics:

### Basic Structure

A LaTeX document starts with a declaration of the document class, which sets the overall layout. Then, it includes packages that provide additional functionality. Finally, the document begins with the `\begin{document}` command and ends with `\end{document}`. Here's a simple example:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}  % For advanced math typesetting

\begin{document}
Hello, world!

This is a simple equation: $E = mc^2$.
\end{document}
```

### Mathematical Typesetting

LaTeX excels at mathematical typesetting. Equations can be written inline using single dollar signs (`$...$`) or displayed in a separate line using double dollar signs (`$$...$$`) or the `\begin{equation}` environment.

#### Inline and Display Math

- Inline: `$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$`
- Display: 
  ```latex
  \begin{equation}
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  \end{equation}
  ```

#### Fractions, Summations, Integrals

- Fractions: `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`
- Summation: `\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2`
- Integral: `\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx`

#### Matrices

```latex
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{matrix}
```

#### Aligning Equations

The `align` environment aligns equations at the ampersand (`&`) symbol:

```latex
\begin{align}
a &= b + c \\
E &= mc^2
\end{align}
```

### Advanced Features

LaTeX also supports tables, figures, cross-referencing, bibliographies, and much more. Due to its flexibility and precision, it is the preferred tool for many academics and researchers in STEM fields.

### Learning Resources

- **Online Tutorials**: Websites like Overleaf offer tutorials and templates.
- **Documentation**: The [TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) is a great place to ask questions and learn from others.
- **Books**: Many comprehensive books are available to learn LaTeX in depth.

LaTeX is a skill that grows with use. As you write more complex documents, you'll find yourself learning new commands and methods to make your documents look professional and clear.
