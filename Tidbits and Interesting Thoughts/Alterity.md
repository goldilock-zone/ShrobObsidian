"Alterity" is a term that refers to the concept of "otherness," the state or quality of being different or distinct. It is often used in the fields of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies to describe how differences are constructed and understood in relation to identity, culture, and society.

In philosophy, particularly in existentialism and phenomenology, alterity is a central concept in understanding the self in relation to others. It explores how an individual perceives and interacts with what is perceived as "other." This can include other people, cultures, ideas, or entities that are fundamentally different from one's own self or group.

In anthropology and sociology, alterity is used to examine the ways in which societies and cultures categorize and interact with those who are seen as different, such as foreign groups, minorities, or subcultures. It's a crucial concept in discussions about cultural relativism, ethnocentrism, and the dynamics of in-group and out-group.

Alterity is also significant in post-colonial studies and critical theory, where it's used to analyze and critique the construction and representation of the "other," often in the context of power dynamics, colonialism, and cultural hegemony.

The concept of alterity is closely related to, but distinct from, concepts like diversity and multiculturalism. While these concepts also deal with difference and otherness, alterity specifically emphasizes the relational and often subjective nature of perceiving and interacting with what is considered to be "other."

Note: 
I am wondering as to how the pyschology of alterity works within the social sciences, in large versions of human populations
