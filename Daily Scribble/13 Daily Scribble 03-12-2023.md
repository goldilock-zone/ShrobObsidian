Using modular arithmetic, we find:
- $11^3 \mod 37 = 36$
- $31^4 \mod 37 = 1$

Now, let's find the remainder when $31^{29} + 48^{29}$ is divided by 37. We can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify this expression. 

Given $31^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{37}$, we can raise both sides to the 7th power to get $31^{28} \equiv 1^7 \pmod{37}$, which simplifies to $31^{28} \equiv 1 \pmod{37}$. Then we multiply both sides by 31 to get $31^{29} \equiv 31 \pmod{37}$.

For $48^{29}$, we first note that $48 \equiv 11 \pmod{37}$, so $48^{29} \equiv 11^{29} \pmod{37}$. Since $11^3 \equiv 36 \pmod{37}$, we can express $11^{29}$ as $(11^3)^9 \cdot 11^2$, and then use modular properties to simplify it.

Let's calculate these values.

Using modular arithmetic, we find:
- $31^{29} \equiv 31 \pmod{37}$
- $48^{29} \equiv 27 \pmod{37}$

Now, to find the remainder when $31^{29} + 48^{29}$ is divided by 37, we sum these results and find the modulus with 37:

$$31 + 27 \mod 37$$

Let's calculate this final value.

The remainder when $31^{29} + 48^{29}$ is divided by 37 is 21.





In modular arithmetic, finding the multiplicative inverse of a number $a$ modulo $n$ involves finding another number $b$ such that:

$$ ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n} $$

This means that the product of $a$ and $b$ is congruent to 1 modulo $n$. The number $b$ is called the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $n$, often denoted as $a^{-1}$.

There are different methods to find the multiplicative inverse:

1. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This is the most efficient and general method. It is based on the fact that $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$ if and only if $a$ and $n$ are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1). The extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + ny = \gcd(a, n)$. If $\gcd(a, n) = 1$, then $ax \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, and hence, $x$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $n$.

2. **Fermat's Little Theorem**: This is applicable when $n$ is a prime number. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if $p$ is prime and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. It follows that $a^{p-2} \equiv a^{-1} \pmod{p}$.

3. **Trial and Error**: This is a less efficient method, especially for large numbers, but it involves simply trying different values of $b$ until you find one that satisfies $ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.

The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is typically the preferred method due to its generality and efficiency. Would you like to see a practical example of finding a multiplicative inverse using one of these methods?
