- The picture that indie-futurisms build in my head is - a lightning bolt passing from a root node, down to the most basic levels. However the graph structure that we have is built with several nodes, and these nodes "pulse". These pulses travel through the graph system, and emerge out at "becoming" nodes. These becoming nodes are the the heart of the graph structure. 
- **Indie-futurisms are events - those that only become possible when multiple networks are traced and overlaid through a rigorous de-stratification and re-stratification to create a plane of entanglement. On this plane of entanglement, potential exists.** - this means that the closer the "becoming" is to the Centre, it's somehow in a higher plane? 
- Â **Indie-Futurisms potentially exist in sites of production, sites of storage, sites of participation and sites of indeterminacy.** - This is interesting, could we build the cascading 3D structure, into a a potential 4D space, where moving through the 4th D, leaving the rest constant, were are moving between different subjectivities of production, storage, participation and indeterminacy. 
- **These game-worlds demonstrate in miniature their own networked ecologies** - This is what my structure deals with either way.
