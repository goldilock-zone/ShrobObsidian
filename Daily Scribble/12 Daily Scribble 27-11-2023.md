- The archetype of the suffering artist
- He had a bullet in his stomach
- He had a litany of mental illnesses
- Vincent was sad, and had his heart broken
- He started his art at 27
- He was angry. He was banned from several institutions
- He had two personalities: One infinitely gifted and refined, and the other egotistical and anger
- The brothers loved each other
- Theo set Vincent in Arles with a studio
- We turned into manic, psychotic
- He had a state of degrading sanity
- Van Gogh was in delusion, and cut off his own earlobe
- Horrifying hallucination
- He was intense
- Theo was a good person
- "He has the rest he longed for"
- Was he really wounded?
- Too close to suicide, but never actually did it - drowning
- Obsessed with writing letters
- Dead
- The gun that he shot himself with was never founded
- Vincent was protecting the boys, who possibly shot him
- Homicide
- No black powder burns
- Much of his life was stolen from him, violently strapped to the backseat of his life
